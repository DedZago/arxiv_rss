  <p>This paper introduces a visual sandbox designed to explore the training dynamics of a small-scale transformer model, with the embedding dimension constrained to $d=2$. This restriction allows for a comprehensive two-dimensional visualization of each layer’s dynamics. Through this approach, we gain insights into training dynamics, circuit transferability, and the causes of loss spikes, including those induced by the high curvature of normalization layers. We propose strategies to mitigate these spikes, demonstrating how good visualization facilitates the design of innovative ideas of practical interest. Additionally, we believe our sandbox could assist theoreticians in assessing essential training dynamics mechanisms and integrating them into future theories.
