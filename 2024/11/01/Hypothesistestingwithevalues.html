The book is organized into three parts: Fundamental Concepts, Core Ideas, and Advanced Topics. The first part includes three chapters that introduce the basic concepts.

  <h1>Hypothesis testing with e-values</h1>

  <br> [stat.ME,stat.TH]

  <p>This book is written to offer a humble, but unified, treatment of e-values in hypothesis testing. The book is organized into three parts: Fundamental Concepts, Core Ideas, and Advanced Topics. The first part includes three chapters that introduce the basic concepts. The second part includes five chapters of core ideas such as universal inference, log-optimality, e-processes, operations on e-values, and e-values in multiple testing. The third part contains five chapters of advanced topics. We hope that, by putting the materials together in this book, the concept of e-values becomes more accessible for educational, research, and practical use.</p>
