<meta name="description" content="Multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) commonly arises in various scientific fields, from genomics to psychology, where testing many hypotheses simultaneously increases the risk of Type-I errors. These errors can mislead scientific inquiry, rendering MHT corrections essential. In this paper, we address MHT within the context of conformal prediction, a flexible method for predictive uncertainty quantification. Some conformal prediction settings can require simultaneous testing, and positive dependencies among tests typically exist. We propose a novel correction named $\texttt{max-rank}$ that leverages these dependencies, whilst ensuring that the joint Type-I error rate is efficiently controlled. Inspired by permutation-based corrections from Westfall &amp; Young (1993), $\texttt{max-rank}$ exploits rank order information to improve performance, and readily integrates with any conformal procedure. We demonstrate both its theoretical and empirical advantages over the common Bonferroni correction and its compatibility with conformal prediction, highlighting the potential to enhance predictive uncertainty quantification." />

  <p>Multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) commonly arises in various scientific fields, from genomics to psychology, where testing many hypotheses simultaneously increases the risk of Type-I errors. These errors can mislead scientific inquiry, rendering MHT corrections essential. In this paper, we address MHT within the context of conformal prediction, a flexible method for predictive uncertainty quantification. Some conformal prediction settings can require simultaneous testing, and positive dependencies among tests typically exist. We propose a novel correction named $\texttt{max-rank}$ that leverages these dependencies, whilst ensuring that the joint Type-I error rate is efficiently controlled. Inspired by permutation-based corrections from Westfall &amp; Young (1993), $\texttt{max-rank}$ exploits rank order information to improve performance, and readily integrates with any conformal procedure. We demonstrate both its theoretical and empirical advantages over the common Bonferroni correction and its compatibility with conformal prediction, highlighting the potential to enhance predictive uncertainty quantification.</p>
