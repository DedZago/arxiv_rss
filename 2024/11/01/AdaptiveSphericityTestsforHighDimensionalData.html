  <p>In this paper, we investigate sphericity testing in high-dimensional settings, where existing methods primarily rely on sum-type test procedures that often underperform under sparse alternatives. To address this limitation, we propose two max-type test procedures utilizing the sample covariance matrix and the sample spatial-sign covariance matrix, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two Cauchy combination test procedures that integrate both sum-type and max-type tests, demonstrating their superiority across a wide range of sparsity levels in the alternative hypothesis. Our simulation studies corroborate these findings, highlighting the enhanced performance of our proposed methodologies in high-dimensional sphericity testi</p>
