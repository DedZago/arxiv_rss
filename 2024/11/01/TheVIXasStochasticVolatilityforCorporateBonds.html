  <p>Classic stochastic volatility models assume volatility is unobservable. We use the VIX for consider it observable, and use the Volatility Index: S\&amp;P 500 VIX. This index was designed to measure volatility of S&amp;P 500. We apply it to a different segment: Corporate bond markets. We fit time series models for spreads between corporate and 10-year Treasury bonds. Next, we divide residuals by VIX. Our main idea is such division makes residuals closer to the ideal case of a Gaussian white noise. This is remarkable, since these residuals and VIX come from separate market segments. We conclude with the analysis of long-term behavior of these models.</p>
