<meta name="description" content="In the past few years, it has been shown that deep learning systems are highly vulnerable under attacks with adversarial examples. Neural-network-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are no exception. Targeted and untargeted attacks can modify an audio input signal in such a way that humans still recognise the same words, while ASR systems are steered to predict a different transcription. In this paper, we propose a defense mechanism against targeted adversarial attacks consisting in removing fast-changing features from the audio signals, either by applying slow feature analysis, a low-pass filter, or both, before feeding the input to the ASR system. We perform an empirical analysis of hybrid ASR models trained on data pre-processed in such a way. While the resulting models perform quite well on benign data, they are significantly more robust against targeted adversarial attacks: Our final, proposed model shows a performance on clean data similar to the baseline model, while being more than four times more robust." />

  <p>In the past few years, it has been shown that deep learning systems are highly vulnerable under attacks with adversarial examples. Neural-network-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are no exception. Targeted and untargeted attacks can modify an audio input signal in such a way that humans still recognise the same words, while ASR systems are steered to predict a different transcription. In this paper, we propose a defense mechanism against targeted adversarial attacks consisting in removing fast-changing features from the audio signals, either by applying slow feature analysis, a low-pass filter, or both, before feeding the input to the ASR system. We perform an empirical analysis of hybrid ASR models trained on data pre-processed in such a way. While the resulting models perform quite well on benign data, they are significantly more robust against targeted adversarial attacks: Our final, proposed model shows a performance on clean data similar to the baseline model, while being more than four times more robust.</p>
