  <p>Hyperparameters are configuration variables controlling the behavior of machine learning algorithms. They are ubiquitous in machine learning and artificial intelligence and the choice of their values determine the effectiveness of systems based on these technologies. Manual hyperparameter search is often unsatisfactory and becomes unfeasible when the number of hyperparameters is large. Automating the search is an important step towards automating machine learning, freeing researchers and practitioners alike from the burden of finding a good set of hyperparameters by trial and error. In this survey, we present a unified treatment of hyperparameter optimization, providing the reader with examples and insights into the state-of-the-art. We cover the main families of techniques to automate hyperparameter search, often referred to as hyperparameter optimization or tuning, including random and quasi-random search, bandit-, model- and gradient- based approaches. We further discuss extensions, including online, constrained, and multi-objective formulations, touch upon connections with other fields such as meta-learning and neural architecture search, and conclude with open questions and future research directions.</p>
