Compared to standard periodograms that utilize static smoothing with a fixed window width, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm smoothing utilize dynamic smoothing with a variable window width. This article begins with a summary of its statistical derivation and development followed by instructions for accessing and utilizing this approach within the R statistical program platform.
