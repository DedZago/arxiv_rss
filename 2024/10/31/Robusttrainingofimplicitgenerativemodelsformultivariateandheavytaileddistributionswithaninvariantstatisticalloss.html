  <p>Traditional implicit generative models are capable of learning highly complex data distributions. However, their training involves distinguishing real data from synthetically generated data using adversarial discriminators, which can lead to unstable training dynamics and mode dropping issues. In this work, we build on the \textit{invariant statistical loss} (ISL) method introduced in \cite{de2024training}, and extend it to handle heavy-tailed and multivariate data distributions.
  The data generated by many real-world phenomena can only be properly characterised using heavy-tailed probability distributions, and traditional implicit methods struggle to effectively capture their asymptotic behavior. To address this problem, we introduce a generator trained with ISL, that uses input noise from a generalised Pareto distribution (GPD). We refer to this generative scheme as Pareto-ISL for conciseness. Our experiments demonstrate that Pareto-ISL accurately models the tails of the distributions while still effectively capturing their central characteristics.
  The original ISL function was conceived for 1D data sets.
