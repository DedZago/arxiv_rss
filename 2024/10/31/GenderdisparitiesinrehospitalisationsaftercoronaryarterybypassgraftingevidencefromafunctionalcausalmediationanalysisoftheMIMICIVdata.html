<meta name="description" content="Hospital readmissions following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) not only impose a substantial cost burden on healthcare systems but also serve as a potential indicator of the quality of medical care. Previous studies of gender effects on complications after CABG surgery have consistently revealed that women tend to suffer worse outcomes. To better understand the causal pathway from gender to the number of rehospitalisations, we study the postoperative central venous pressure (CVP), frequently recorded over patients’ intensive care unit (ICU) stay after the CABG surgery, as a functional mediator. Confronted with time-varying CVP measurements and zero-inflated rehospitalisation counts within 60 days following discharge, we propose a parameter-simulating quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo approximation method that accommodates a functional mediator and a zero-inflated count outcome for causal mediation analysis. We find a causal relationship between the female gender and increased rehospitalisation counts after CABG, and that time-varying central venous pressure mediates this causal effect." />

  <p>Hospital readmissions following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) not only impose a substantial cost burden on healthcare systems but also serve as a potential indicator of the quality of medical care. Previous studies of gender effects on complications after CABG surgery have consistently revealed that women tend to suffer worse outcomes. To better understand the causal pathway from gender to the number of rehospitalisations, we study the postoperative central venous pressure (CVP), frequently recorded over patients’ intensive care unit (ICU) stay after the CABG surgery, as a functional mediator. Confronted with time-varying CVP measurements and zero-inflated rehospitalisation counts within 60 days following discharge, we propose a parameter-simulating quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo approximation method that accommodates a functional mediator and a zero-inflated count outcome for causal mediation analysis. We find a causal relationship between the female gender and increased rehospitalisation counts after CABG, and that time-varying central venous pressure mediates this causal effect.</p>
