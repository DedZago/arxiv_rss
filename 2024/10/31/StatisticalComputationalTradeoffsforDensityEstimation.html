  <p>We study the density estimation problem defined as follows: given $k$ distributions $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ over a discrete domain $[n]$, as well as a collection of samples chosen from a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">query'' distribution $q$ over $[n]$, output $p_i$ that is</code>close’’ to $q$. Recently~\cite{aamand2023data} gave the first and only known result that achieves sublinear bounds in {\em both} the sampling complexity and the query time while preserving polynomial data structure space. However, their improvement over linear samples and time is only by subpolynomial factors.
  Our main result is a lower bound showing that, for a broad class of data structures, their bounds cannot be significantly improved. In particular, if an algorithm uses $O(n/\log^c k)$ samples for some constant $c&gt;0$ and polynomial space, then the query time of the data structure must be at least $k^{1-O(1)/\log \log k}$, i.e., close to linear in the number of distributions $k$. This is a novel \emph{statistical-computational} trade-off for density estimation, demonstrating that any data structure must use close to a linear number of samples or take close to linear query time. The lower bound holds even in the realizable case where $q=p_i$ for some $i$, and when the distributions are flat (specifically, all distributions are uniform over half of the domain $[n]$). We also give a simple data structure for our lower bound instance with asymptotically matching upper bounds. Experiments show that the data structure is quite efficient in practice.</p>
