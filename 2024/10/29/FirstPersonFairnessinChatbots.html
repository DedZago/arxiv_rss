  <p>Chatbots like ChatGPT are used for diverse purposes, ranging from resume writing to entertainment. These real-world applications are different from the institutional uses, such as resume screening or credit scoring, which have been the focus of much of AI research on fairness. Ensuring equitable treatment for all users in these first-person contexts is critical. In this work, we study “first-person fairness,” which means fairness toward the chatbot user.
