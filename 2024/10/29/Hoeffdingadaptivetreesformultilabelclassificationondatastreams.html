Stream learning aims at developing models that can process instances as they arrive, so models constantly adapt to new concepts and the temporal evolution in the stream.

MLHAT leverages the Hoeffding adaptive tree to address these challenges by considering possible relations and label co-occurrences in the partitioning process of the decision tree, dynamically adapting the learner in each leaf node of the tree, and implementing a concept drift detector that can quickly detect and replace tree branches that are no longer performing well. The proposed approach is compared with other 18 online multi-label classifiers on 41 datasets. The results, validated with statistical analysis, show that MLHAT outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in 12 well-known multi-label metrics." />

  <p>Data stream learning is a very relevant paradigm because of the increasing real-world scenarios generating data at high velocities and in unbounded sequences. Stream learning aims at developing models that can process instances as they arrive, so models constantly adapt to new concepts and the temporal evolution in the stream. In multi-label data stream environments where instances have the peculiarity of belonging simultaneously to more than one class, the problem becomes even more complex and poses unique challenges such as different concept drifts impacting different labels at simultaneous or distinct times, higher class imbalance, or new labels emerging in the stream. This paper proposes a novel approach to multi-label data stream classification called Multi-Label Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (MLHAT). MLHAT leverages the Hoeffding adaptive tree to address these challenges by considering possible relations and label co-occurrences in the partitioning process of the decision tree, dynamically adapting the learner in each leaf node of the tree, and implementing a concept drift detector that can quickly detect and replace tree branches that are no longer performing well. The proposed approach is compared with other 18 online multi-label classifiers on 41 datasets. The results, validated with statistical analysis, show that MLHAT outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in 12 well-known multi-label metrics.</p>
