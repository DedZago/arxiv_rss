  <h1>Improving Detection of Person Class Using Dense Pooling</h1>

  <br> []

  <p>Lately, the continuous development of deep learning models by many researchers in the area of computer vision has attracted more researchers to further improve the accuracy of these models. FasterRCNN [32] has already provided a state-of-the-art approach to improve the accuracy and detection of 80 different objects given in the COCO dataset. To further improve the performance of person detection we have conducted a different approach which gives the state-of-the-art conclusion. An ROI is a step in FasterRCNN that extract the features from the given image with a fixed size and transfer into for further classification. To enhance the ROI performance, we have conducted an approach that implements dense pooling and converts the image into a 3D model to further transform into UV(ultra Violet) images which makes it easy to extract the right features from the images. To implement our approach we have approached the state-of-the-art COCO datasets and extracted 6982 images that include a person object and our final achievements conclude that using our approach has made significant results in detecting the person object in the given image</p>
