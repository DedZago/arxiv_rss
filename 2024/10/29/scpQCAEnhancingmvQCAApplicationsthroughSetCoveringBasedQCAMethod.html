This article addresses the limitations of the QCA method in its application, specifically in terms of low coverage, factor limitations, and value limitations. scpQCA enhances the coverage of results and expands the tolerance of the QCA method for multi-factor and multi-valued analyses by maintaining the consistency threshold. To validate these capabilities, we conducted experiments on both random data and specific case datasets, utilizing different approaches of CCM (Configurational Comparative Methods) such as scpQCA, CNA, and QCApro, and presented the different results. In addition, the robustness of scpQCA has been examined from the perspectives of internal and external across different case datasets, thereby demonstrating its extensive applicability and advantages over existing QCA algorithms." />

  <p>In fields such as sociology, political science, public administration, and business management, particularly in the direction of international relations, Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) has been widely adopted as a research method. This article addresses the limitations of the QCA method in its application, specifically in terms of low coverage, factor limitations, and value limitations. scpQCA enhances the coverage of results and expands the tolerance of the QCA method for multi-factor and multi-valued analyses by maintaining the consistency threshold. To validate these capabilities, we conducted experiments on both random data and specific case datasets, utilizing different approaches of CCM (Configurational Comparative Methods) such as scpQCA, CNA, and QCApro, and presented the different results. In addition, the robustness of scpQCA has been examined from the perspectives of internal and external across different case datasets, thereby demonstrating its extensive applicability and advantages over existing QCA algorithms.</p>
