  <p>We propose a difference-in-differences (DiD) method for a time-varying continuous treatment and multiple time periods. Our framework assesses the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) when comparing two non-zero treatment doses. The identification is based on a conditional parallel trend assumption imposed on the mean potential outcome under the lower dose, given observed covariates and past treatment histories. We employ kernel-based ATET estimators for repeated cross-sections and panel data adopting the double/debiased machine learning framework to control for covariates and past treatment histories in a data-adaptive manner. We also demonstrate the asymptotic normality of our estimation approach under specific regularity conditions. In a simulation study, we find a compelling finite sample performance of undersmoothed versions of our estimators in setups with several thousand observations.</p>
