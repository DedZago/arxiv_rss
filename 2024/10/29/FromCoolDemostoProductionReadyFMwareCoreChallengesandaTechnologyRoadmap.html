<meta name="description" content="The rapid expansion of foundation models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs), has given rise to FMware–software systems that integrate FMs as core components. While building demonstration-level FMware is relatively straightforward, transitioning to production-ready systems presents numerous challenges, including reliability, high implementation costs, scalability, and compliance with privacy regulations. This paper provides a thematic analysis of the key obstacles in productionizing FMware, synthesized from industry experience and diverse data sources, including hands-on involvement in the Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA) and FMware lifecycle engineering. We identify critical issues in FM selection, data and model alignment, prompt engineering, agent orchestration, system testing, and deployment, alongside cross-cutting concerns such as memory management, observability, and feedback integration. We discuss needed technologies and strategies to address these challenges and offer guidance on how to enable the transition from demonstration systems to scalable, production-ready FMware solutions. Our findings underscore the importance of continued research and multi-industry collaboration to advance the development of production-ready FMware." />

  <p>The rapid expansion of foundation models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs), has given rise to FMware–software systems that integrate FMs as core components. While building demonstration-level FMware is relatively straightforward, transitioning to production-ready systems presents numerous challenges, including reliability, high implementation costs, scalability, and compliance with privacy regulations. This paper provides a thematic analysis of the key obstacles in productionizing FMware, synthesized from industry experience and diverse data sources, including hands-on involvement in the Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA) and FMware lifecycle engineering. We identify critical issues in FM selection, data and model alignment, prompt engineering, agent orchestration, system testing, and deployment, alongside cross-cutting concerns such as memory management, observability, and feedback integration. We discuss needed technologies and strategies to address these challenges and offer guidance on how to enable the transition from demonstration systems to scalable, production-ready FMware solutions. Our findings underscore the importance of continued research and multi-industry collaboration to advance the development of production-ready FMware.</p>
