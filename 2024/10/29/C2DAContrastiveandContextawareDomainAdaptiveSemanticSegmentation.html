  <p>Unsupervised domain adaptive semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to train a model on the source domain data (e.g., synthetic) and adapt the model to predict target domain data (e.g., real-world) without accessing target annotation data. Most existing UDA-SS methods only focus on inter-domain knowledge to mitigate the data-shift problem. However, learning the inherent structure of the images and exploring the intrinsic pixel distribution of both domains are ignored, which prevents the UDA-SS methods from producing satisfactory performance like supervised learning. Moreover, incorporating contextual knowledge is also often overlooked. Considering these issues, in this work, we propose a UDA-SS framework that learns both intra-domain and context-aware knowledge. To learn the intra-domain knowledge, we incorporate contrastive loss in both domains, which pulls pixels of similar classes together and pushes the rest away, facilitating intra-image-pixel-wise correlations.
