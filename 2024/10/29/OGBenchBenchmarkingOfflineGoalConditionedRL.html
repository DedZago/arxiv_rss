<meta name="description" content="Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a major problem in reinforcement learning (RL) because it provides a simple, unsupervised, and domain-agnostic way to acquire diverse behaviors and representations from unlabeled data without rewards. Despite the importance of this setting, we lack a standard benchmark that can systematically evaluate the capabilities of offline GCRL algorithms. In this work, we propose OGBench, a new, high-quality benchmark for algorithms research in offline goal-conditioned RL. OGBench consists of 8 types of environments, 85 datasets, and reference implementations of 6 representative offline GCRL algorithms. We have designed these challenging and realistic environments and datasets to directly probe different capabilities of algorithms, such as stitching, long-horizon reasoning, and the ability to handle high-dimensional inputs and stochasticity. While representative algorithms may rank similarly on prior benchmarks, our experiments reveal stark strengths and weaknesses in these different capabilities, providing a strong foundation for building new algorithms.

  <p>Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a major problem in reinforcement learning (RL) because it provides a simple, unsupervised, and domain-agnostic way to acquire diverse behaviors and representations from unlabeled data without rewards. Despite the importance of this setting, we lack a standard benchmark that can systematically evaluate the capabilities of offline GCRL algorithms. In this work, we propose OGBench, a new, high-quality benchmark for algorithms research in offline goal-conditioned RL. OGBench consists of 8 types of environments, 85 datasets, and reference implementations of 6 representative offline GCRL algorithms. We have designed these challenging and realistic environments and datasets to directly probe different capabilities of algorithms, such as stitching, long-horizon reasoning, and the ability to handle high-dimensional inputs and stochasticity. While representative algorithms may rank similarly on prior benchmarks, our experiments reveal stark strengths and weaknesses in these different capabilities, providing a strong foundation for building new algorithms.
