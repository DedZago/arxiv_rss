  <p>Real-time lower limb movement resistance monitoring is critical for various applications in clinical and sports settings, such as rehabilitation and athletic training. Current methods often face limitations in accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability, which hinder their practical implementation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Mobile Multi-Task Learning Network (MMTL-Net) that integrates MobileNetV3 for efficient feature extraction and employs multi-task learning to simultaneously predict resistance levels and recognize activities. The advantages of MMTL-Net include enhanced accuracy, reduced latency, and improved computational efficiency, making it highly suitable for real-time applications.

Additionally, the model shows a Real-time Responsiveness (RTR) of 12 milliseconds and a Throughput (TP) of 33 frames per second. These findings underscore the model’s robustness and effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios. The proposed framework not only advances the state-of-the-art in resistance monitoring but also paves the way for more efficient and accurate systems in clinical and sports applications.
