  <p>Novel optical imaging techniques, such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with machine learning-based (ML) analysis, have the potential to revolutionize clinical surgical imaging. However, these novel modalities face a shortage of large-scale, representative clinical data for training ML algorithms, while preclinical animal data is abundantly available through standardized experiments and allows for controlled induction of pathological tissue states, which is not ethically possible in patients. To leverage this situation, we propose a novel concept called “xeno-learning”, a cross-species knowledge transfer paradigm inspired by xeno-transplantation, where organs from a donor species are transplanted into a recipient species. Using a total of 11,268 HSI images from humans as well as porcine and rat models, we show that although spectral signatures of organs differ across species, shared pathophysiological mechanisms manifest as comparable relative spectral changes across species. Such changes learnt in one species can thus be transferred to a new species via a novel “physiology-based data augmentation” method, enabling the large-scale secondary use of preclinical animal data for humans. The resulting ethical, monetary, and performance benefits of the proposed knowledge transfer paradigm promise a high impact of the methodology on future developments in the field.</p>
