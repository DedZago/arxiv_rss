<meta name="description" content="Traumatic brain injury (TBI) presents a significant public health challenge, often resulting in mortality or lasting disability. Predicting outcomes such as mortality and Functional Status Scale (FSS) scores can enhance treatment strategies and inform clinical decision-making. This study applies supervised machine learning (ML) methods to predict mortality and FSS scores using a real-world dataset of 300 pediatric TBI patients from the University of Colorado School of Medicine. The dataset captures clinical features, including demographics, injury mechanisms, and hospitalization outcomes. Eighteen ML models were evaluated for mortality prediction, and thirteen models were assessed for FSS score prediction. Performance was measured using accuracy, ROC AUC, F1-score, and mean squared error. Logistic regression and Extra Trees models achieved high precision in mortality prediction, while linear regression demonstrated the best FSS score prediction. Feature selection reduced 103 clinical variables to the most relevant, enhancing model efficiency and interpretability. This research highlights the role of ML models in identifying high-risk patients and supporting personalized interventions, demonstrating the potential of data-driven analytics to improve TBI care and integrate into clinical workflows." />

  <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) presents a significant public health challenge, often resulting in mortality or lasting disability. Predicting outcomes such as mortality and Functional Status Scale (FSS) scores can enhance treatment strategies and inform clinical decision-making. This study applies supervised machine learning (ML) methods to predict mortality and FSS scores using a real-world dataset of 300 pediatric TBI patients from the University of Colorado School of Medicine. The dataset captures clinical features, including demographics, injury mechanisms, and hospitalization outcomes. Eighteen ML models were evaluated for mortality prediction, and thirteen models were assessed for FSS score prediction. Performance was measured using accuracy, ROC AUC, F1-score, and mean squared error. Logistic regression and Extra Trees models achieved high precision in mortality prediction, while linear regression demonstrated the best FSS score prediction. Feature selection reduced 103 clinical variables to the most relevant, enhancing model efficiency and interpretability.
