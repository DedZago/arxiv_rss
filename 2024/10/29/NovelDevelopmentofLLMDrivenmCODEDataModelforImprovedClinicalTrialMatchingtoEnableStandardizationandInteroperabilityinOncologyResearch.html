  <p>Each year, the lack of efficient data standardization and interoperability in cancer care contributes to the severe lack of timely and effective diagnosis, while constantly adding to the burden of cost, with cancer costs nationally reaching over $208 billion in 2023 alone. Traditional methods regarding clinical trial enrollment and clinical care in oncology are often manual, time-consuming, and lack a data-driven approach. This paper presents a novel framework to streamline standardization, interoperability, and exchange of cancer domains and enhance the integration of oncology-based EHRs across disparate healthcare systems. This paper utilizes advanced LLMs and Computer Engineering to streamline cancer clinical trials and discovery. By utilizing FHIR’s resource-based approach and LLM-generated mCODE profiles, we ensure timely, accurate, and efficient sharing of patient information across disparate healthcare systems. Our methodology involves transforming unstructured patient treatment data, PDFs, free-text information, and progress notes into enriched mCODE profiles, facilitating seamless integration with our novel AI and ML-based clinical trial matching engine.
