  <br> []

  <p>We consider the dynamics of bodies with “active” microstructure described by vectorvalued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the phase field. In the presence of non-normality, the spectral analysis of such a matrix when (unknown or uncertain or time-dependent) constitutive parameters vary is generically not decisive to evaluate the material stability. We thus need to look at the pseudospectrum, that is, the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in an {\epsilon}-neighborhood of the matrix of interest. As a case study, we look at quasicrystals and evaluate through spectra and pseudospectra the influence of a microstructural self-action on the material stability. This approach allows us to reliably determine thresholds where stable-unstable transitions in the material behavior occur.</p>
