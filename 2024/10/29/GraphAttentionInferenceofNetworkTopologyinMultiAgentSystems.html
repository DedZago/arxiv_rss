  <p>Accurately identifying the underlying graph structures of multi-agent systems remains a difficult challenge. Our work introduces a novel machine learning-based solution that leverages the attention mechanism to predict future states of multi-agent systems by learning node representations. The graph structure is then inferred from the strength of the attention values. This approach is applied to both linear consensus dynamics and the non-linear dynamics of Kuramoto oscillators, resulting in implicit learning of the graph by learning good agent representations. Our results demonstrate that the presented data-driven graph attention machine learning model can identify the network topology in multi-agent systems, even when the underlying dynamic model is not known, as evidenced by the F1 scores achieved in the link prediction.</p>
