<meta name="description" content="This study developed a new statistical model and method for analyzing the precision of binary measurement methods from collaborative studies. The model is based on beta-binomial distributions. In other words, it assumes that the sensitivity of each laboratory obeys a beta distribution, and the binary measured values under a given sensitivity follow a binomial distribution. We propose the key precision measures of repeatability and reproducibility for the model, and provide their unbiased estimates. Further, through consideration of a number of statistical test methods for homogeneity of proportions, we propose appropriate methods for determining laboratory effects in the new model. Finally, we apply the results to real-world examples in the fields of food safety and chemical risk assessment and management." />

  <p>This study developed a new statistical model and method for analyzing the precision of binary measurement methods from collaborative studies. The model is based on beta-binomial distributions. In other words, it assumes that the sensitivity of each laboratory obeys a beta distribution, and the binary measured values under a given sensitivity follow a binomial distribution. We propose the key precision measures of repeatability and reproducibility for the model, and provide their unbiased estimates. Further, through consideration of a number of statistical test methods for homogeneity of proportions, we propose appropriate methods for determining laboratory effects in the new model. Finally, we apply the results to real-world examples in the fields of food safety and chemical risk assessment and management.</p>
