<meta name="description" content="Mathematical reasoning has been a challenging aspect of large language models (LLMs). However, the introduction of step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) inference has significantly advanced the mathematical capabilities of LLMs. Despite this progress, current approaches either require massive inference datasets as training datasets or rely on few-shot methods that often sacrifice accuracy. To address this bottleneck in mathematical reasoning, we propose a novel method called Step Guidance Reasoning without involving further model fine-tuning. In this approach, LLMs reflect on small reasoning steps – similar to how humans deliberate on and focus attention on what to do next. By incorporating this reflective process into the inference stage, LLMs can effectively guide their reasoning from one step to the next. Our method significantly improved the math performance, raising the accuracy on the AMC23 dataset from 30% to 57.5%, a relative improvement of 91.7%, and on the sampled level 5 problem of the MATH dataset, we achieved a relative accuracy improvement of 55.8%, increasing from 43% to 67%." />

  <p>Mathematical reasoning has been a challenging aspect of large language models (LLMs). However, the introduction of step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) inference has significantly advanced the mathematical capabilities of LLMs. Despite this progress, current approaches either require massive inference datasets as training datasets or rely on few-shot methods that often sacrifice accuracy. To address this bottleneck in mathematical reasoning, we propose a novel method called Step Guidance Reasoning without involving further model fine-tuning. In this approach, LLMs reflect on small reasoning steps – similar to how humans deliberate on and focus attention on what to do next. By incorporating this reflective process into the inference stage, LLMs can effectively guide their reasoning from one step to the next. Our method significantly improved the math performance, raising the accuracy on the AMC23 dataset from 30% to 57.5%, a relative improvement of 91.7%, and on the sampled level 5 problem of the MATH dataset, we achieved a relative accuracy improvement of 55.8%, increasing from 43% to 67%.</p>
