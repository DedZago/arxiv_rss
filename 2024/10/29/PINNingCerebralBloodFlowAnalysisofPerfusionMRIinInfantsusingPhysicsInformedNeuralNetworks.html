<meta name="description" content="Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables cerebral perfusion measurement, which is crucial in detecting and managing neurological issues in infants born prematurely or after perinatal complications.

We propose a new spatial uncertainty-based physics-informed neural network (PINN), SUPINN, to estimate CBF and other parameters from infant ASL data.
