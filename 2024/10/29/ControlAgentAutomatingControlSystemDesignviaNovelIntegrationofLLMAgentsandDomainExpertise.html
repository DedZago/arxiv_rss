Combined with a history and feedback module, the task-specific LLM agents iteratively refine controller parameters based on real-time feedback from prior designs.

  <p>Control system design is a crucial aspect of modern engineering with far-reaching applications across diverse sectors including aerospace, automotive systems, power grids, and robotics. Despite advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains, their application in control system design remains limited due to the complexity and specificity of control theory. To bridge this gap, we introduce ControlAgent, a new paradigm that automates control system design via novel integration of LLM agents and control-oriented domain expertise.
