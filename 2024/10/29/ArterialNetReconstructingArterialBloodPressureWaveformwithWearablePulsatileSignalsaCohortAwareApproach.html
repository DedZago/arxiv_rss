  <p>Continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring is invasive but essential for hemodynamic monitoring. Recent techniques have reconstructed ABP non-invasively using pulsatile signals but produced inaccurate systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) values and were sensitive to individual variability. ArterialNet integrates generalized pulsatile-to-ABP signal translation and personalized feature extraction using hybrid loss functions and regularization. We validated ArterialNet using the MIMIC-III dataset and achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.41 mmHg, with at least a 58% lower standard deviation. ArterialNet reconstructed ABP with an RMSE of 7.99 mmHg in remote health scenarios. ArterialNet achieved superior performance in ABP reconstruction and SBP and DBP estimations, with significantly reduced subject variance, demonstrating its potential in remote health settings. We also ablated ArterialNet architecture to investigate the contributions of each component and evaluated its translational impact and robustness by conducting a series of ablations on data quality and availability.</p>
