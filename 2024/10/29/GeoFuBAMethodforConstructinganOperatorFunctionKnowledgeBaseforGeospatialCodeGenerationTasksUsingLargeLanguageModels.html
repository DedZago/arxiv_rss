  <p>The rise of spatiotemporal data and the need for efficient geospatial modeling have spurred interest in automating these tasks with large language models (LLMs).

To address this, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, utilizing an external knowledge base of geospatial functions and operators, is proposed. This study introduces a framework to construct such a knowledge base, leveraging geospatial script semantics.
