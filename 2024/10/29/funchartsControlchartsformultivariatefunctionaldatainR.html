  <p>Modern statistical process monitoring (SPM) applications focus on profile monitoring, i.e., the monitoring of process quality characteristics that can be modeled as profiles, also known as functional data. Despite the large interest in the profile monitoring literature, there is still a lack of software to facilitate its practical application. This article introduces the funcharts R package that implements recent developments on the SPM of multivariate functional quality characteristics, possibly adjusted by the influence of additional variables, referred to as covariates. The package also implements the real-time version of all control charting procedures to monitor profiles partially observed up to an intermediate domain point. The package is illustrated both through its built-in data generator and a real-case study on the SPM of Ro-Pax ship CO2 emissions during navigation, which is based on the ShipNavigation data provided in the Supplementary Material.</p>
