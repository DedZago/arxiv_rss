  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) empowers agents to acquire various skills by learning from reward signals. Unfortunately, designing high-quality instance-level rewards often demands significant effort. An emerging alternative, RL with delayed reward, focuses on learning from rewards presented periodically, which can be obtained from human evaluators assessing the agent’s performance over sequences of behaviors. However, traditional methods in this domain assume the existence of underlying Markovian rewards and that the observed delayed reward is simply the sum of instance-level rewards, both of which often do not align well with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the problem of RL from Composite Delayed Reward (RLCoDe), which generalizes traditional RL from delayed rewards by eliminating the strong assumption. We suggest that the delayed reward may arise from a more complex structure reflecting the overall contribution of the sequence. To address this problem, we present a framework for modeling composite delayed rewards, using a weighted sum of non-Markovian components to capture the different contributions of individual steps. Building on this framework, we propose Composite Delayed Reward Transformer (CoDeTr), which incorporates a specialized in-sequence attention mechanism to effectively model these contributions. We conduct experiments on challenging locomotion tasks where the agent receives delayed rewards computed from composite functions of observable step rewards. The experimental results indicate that CoDeTr consistently outperforms baseline methods across evaluated metrics.
