<meta name="description" content="This work contributes to the field of Machine Ethics (ME) benchmarking, which develops tests to assess whether intelligent systems accurately represent human values and act accordingly. We identify three major issues with current ME benchmarks: limited ecological validity due to unrealistic ethical dilemmas, unstructured question generation without clear inclusion/exclusion criteria, and a lack of scalability due to reliance on human annotations. Moreover, benchmarks often fail to include sufficient syntactic variations, reducing the robustness of findings. To address these gaps, we introduce two new ME benchmarks: the Triage Benchmark and the Medical Law (MedLaw) Benchmark, both featuring real-world ethical dilemmas from the medical domain. The MedLaw Benchmark, fully AI-generated, offers a scalable alternative. We also introduce context perturbations in our benchmarks to assess models’ worst-case performance. Our findings reveal that ethics prompting does not always improve decision-making. Furthermore, context perturbations not only significantly reduce model performance but can also reverse error patterns and shift relative performance rankings. Lastly, our comparison of worst-case performance suggests that general model capability does not always predict strong ethical decision-making. We argue that ME benchmarks must approximate real-world scenarios and worst-case performance to ensure robust evaluation." />

  <p>This work contributes to the field of Machine Ethics (ME) benchmarking, which develops tests to assess whether intelligent systems accurately represent human values and act accordingly. We identify three major issues with current ME benchmarks: limited ecological validity due to unrealistic ethical dilemmas, unstructured question generation without clear inclusion/exclusion criteria, and a lack of scalability due to reliance on human annotations. Moreover, benchmarks often fail to include sufficient syntactic variations, reducing the robustness of findings. To address these gaps, we introduce two new ME benchmarks: the Triage Benchmark and the Medical Law (MedLaw) Benchmark, both featuring real-world ethical dilemmas from the medical domain. The MedLaw Benchmark, fully AI-generated, offers a scalable alternative. We also introduce context perturbations in our benchmarks to assess models’ worst-case performance. Our findings reveal that ethics prompting does not always improve decision-making. Furthermore, context perturbations not only significantly reduce model performance but can also reverse error patterns and shift relative performance rankings. Lastly, our comparison of worst-case performance suggests that general model capability does not always predict strong ethical decision-making. We argue that ME benchmarks must approximate real-world scenarios and worst-case performance to ensure robust evaluation.</p>
