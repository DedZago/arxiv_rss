<meta name="description" content="Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for accurate diagnosisand treatment planning, but the small size and irregular shapeof tumors pose significant challenges. Existing methods of-ten fail to effectively incorporate medical domain knowledgesuch as tumor grade, which correlates with tumor aggres-siveness and morphology, providing critical insights for moreaccurate detection of tumor subregions during segmentation.We propose an Automated and Editable Prompt Learning(AEPL) framework that integrates tumor grade into the seg-mentation process by combining multi-task learning andprompt learning with automatic and editable prompt gen-eration. Specifically, AEPL employs an encoder to extractimage features for both tumor-grade prediction and segmen-tation mask generation. The predicted tumor grades serveas auto-generated prompts, guiding the decoder to produceprecise segmentation masks. This eliminates the need formanual prompts while allowing clinicians to manually editthe auto-generated prompts to fine-tune the segmentation,enhancing both flexibility and precision.

  <p>Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for accurate diagnosisand treatment planning, but the small size and irregular shapeof tumors pose significant challenges. Existing methods of-ten fail to effectively incorporate medical domain knowledgesuch as tumor grade, which correlates with tumor aggres-siveness and morphology, providing critical insights for moreaccurate detection of tumor subregions during segmentation.We propose an Automated and Editable Prompt Learning(AEPL) framework that integrates tumor grade into the seg-mentation process by combining multi-task learning andprompt learning with automatic and editable prompt gen-eration. Specifically, AEPL employs an encoder to extractimage features for both tumor-grade prediction and segmen-tation mask generation. The predicted tumor grades serveas auto-generated prompts, guiding the decoder to produceprecise segmentation masks. This eliminates the need formanual prompts while allowing clinicians to manually editthe auto-generated prompts to fine-tune the segmentation,enhancing both flexibility and precision.
