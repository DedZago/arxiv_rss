We observe a severe bioaccumulative effect of MC-LR in aquatic species, stressing the potential impact on humans and other terrestrial animals. We validate our model with field measurements demonstrating its applicability to several realistic lake conditions.

  <p>Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) have a growing global prevalence, emerging as a significant environmental concern due to their potential toxicity. Understanding how the different mechanisms affect CBs is crucial to develop actionable management strategies. For this, we derive a stoichiometric dynamical system that describes the qualitative population dynamics of cyanobacteria and their toxicity in north-temperate freshwater ecosystems. Our model quantifies the hypoxic effects of CBs on fish mortality and the effect of microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a potent toxin produced by cyanobacteria, on aquatic macro-invertebrates, phytoplankton, and fish species. By fitting the model to lakes with varying physical characteristics, eutrophic conditions, and water temperature, we can delineate and understand the driving components of CBs. We show that decreases in water exchange rate, depth of epilimnion, or light attenuation increases bloom intensity and duration. Furthermore, our models concur that eutrophication and increasing water temperatures exacerbate the intensity of CBs. We observe a severe bioaccumulative effect of MC-LR in aquatic species, stressing the potential impact on humans and other terrestrial animals. We validate our model with field measurements demonstrating its applicability to several realistic lake conditions. These insights are essential for informing targeted interventions to reduce CBs and their ecological impacts.</p>
