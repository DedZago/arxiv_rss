  <p>Large pre-trained models have achieved notable success across a range of downstream tasks. However, recent research shows that a type of adversarial attack ($\textit{i.e.,}$ backdoor attack) can manipulate the behavior of machine learning models through contaminating their training dataset, posing significant threat in the real-world application of large pre-trained model, especially for those customized models. Therefore, addressing the unique challenges for exploring vulnerability of pre-trained models is of paramount importance. Through empirical studies on the capability for performing backdoor attack in large pre-trained models ($\textit{e.g.,}$ ViT), we find the following unique challenges of attacking large pre-trained models: 1) the inability to manipulate or even access large training datasets, and 2) the substantial computational resources required for training or fine-tuning these models. To address these challenges, we establish new standards for an effective and feasible backdoor attack in the context of large pre-trained models. In line with these standards, we introduce our EDT model, an \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{D}ata-free, \textbf{T}raining-free backdoor attack method. Inspired by model editing techniques, EDT injects an editing-based lightweight codebook into the backdoor of large pre-trained models, which replaces the embedding of the poisoned image with the target image without poisoning the training dataset or training the victim model. Our experiments, conducted across various pre-trained models such as ViT, CLIP, BLIP, and stable diffusion, and on downstream tasks including image classification, image captioning, and image generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
