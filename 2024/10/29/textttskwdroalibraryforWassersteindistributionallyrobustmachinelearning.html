  <p>We present skwdro, a Python library for training robust machine learning models. The library is based on distributionally robust optimization using optimal transport distances. For ease of use, it features both scikit-learn compatible estimators for popular objectives, as well as a wrapper for PyTorch modules, enabling researchers and practitioners to use it in a wide range of models with minimal code changes. Its implementation relies on an entropic smoothing of the original robust objective in order to ensure maximal model flexibility. The library is available at https://github.com/iutzeler/skwdro</p>
