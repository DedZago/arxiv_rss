  <p>Reliability is an essential property of scores, which quantifies measurement precision. We expand on the work of McDonald (2011) and present a regression framework of reliability. From this framework, reliability reflects the explained variance in either observed or latent scores assuming an underlying latent variable measurement model. This framework unifies two extant perspectives of reliability: (a) classical test theory (measurement decomposition), and (b) optimal prediction of latent scores (prediction decomposition). The framework also highlights that reliability should be treated as a property of the outcome variable in the regression. As such, reliability is attached to the observed scores under a measurement decomposition but to the latent scores under a prediction decomposition. We introduce a Monte Carlo (MC) approach that calculates values of reliability, which is a direct application of the regression framework. The MC procedure has the advantage of easily obtaining reliability coefficients for complex measurement models, which we illustrate with an empirical example on measuring susceptibility and severity of depressive symptoms using a two-dimensional item response theory model. We conclude with a discussion on computing reliability coefficients and outline future avenues of research.</p>
