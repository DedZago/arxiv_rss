<meta name="description" content="Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) enhance positional encoding in Transformer models, yet their full impact on model dynamics remains underexplored. This paper studies how RoPE introduces position-dependent rotations, causing phase shifts in token embeddings that influence higher-frequency components within the model’s internal representations. Through spectral analysis, we demonstrate that RoPE’s rotation matrices induce oscillatory behaviors in embeddings, affecting information retention across layers and shaping temporal modeling capabilities. We show that activation functions in feed-forward networks interact with RoPE-modulated embeddings to generate harmonics, leading to constructive or destructive interference based on phase alignment. Our findings reveal that phase alignment amplifies activations and sharpens attention, while misalignment weakens activations and disrupts focus on positional patterns.

  <p>Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) enhance positional encoding in Transformer models, yet their full impact on model dynamics remains underexplored. This paper studies how RoPE introduces position-dependent rotations, causing phase shifts in token embeddings that influence higher-frequency components within the model’s internal representations. Through spectral analysis, we demonstrate that RoPE’s rotation matrices induce oscillatory behaviors in embeddings, affecting information retention across layers and shaping temporal modeling capabilities. We show that activation functions in feed-forward networks interact with RoPE-modulated embeddings to generate harmonics, leading to constructive or destructive interference based on phase alignment. Our findings reveal that phase alignment amplifies activations and sharpens attention, while misalignment weakens activations and disrupts focus on positional patterns. This study underscores the importance of frequency components as intrinsic elements of model behavior, offering new insights beyond traditional analyses.</p>
