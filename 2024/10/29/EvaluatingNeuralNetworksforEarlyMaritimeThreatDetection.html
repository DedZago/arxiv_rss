  <p>We consider the task of classifying trajectories of boat activities as a proxy for assessing maritime threats. Previous approaches have considered entropy-based metrics for clustering boat activity into three broad categories: random walk, following, and chasing. Here, we comprehensively assess the accuracy of neural network-based approaches as alternatives to entropy-based clustering. We train four neural network models and compare them to shallow learning using synthetic data. We also investigate the accuracy of models as time steps increase and with and without rotated data. To improve test-time robustness, we normalize trajectories and perform rotation-based data augmentation. Our results show that deep networks can achieve a test-set accuracy of up to 100% on a full trajectory, with graceful degradation as the number of time steps decreases, outperforming entropy-based clustering.</p>
