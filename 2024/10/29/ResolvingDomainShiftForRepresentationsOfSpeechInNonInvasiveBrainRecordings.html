Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide an alternative but come with their own set of challenges, the limited scale of individual studies being among them. Without the ability to pool the recordings from different non-invasive studies, data on the order of magnitude needed to leverage deep learning techniques to their full potential remains out of reach. In this work, we focus on non-invasive data collected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We leverage two different, leading speech decoding models to investigate how an adversarial domain adaptation framework augments their ability to generalize across datasets. We successfully improve the performance of both models when training across multiple datasets.
