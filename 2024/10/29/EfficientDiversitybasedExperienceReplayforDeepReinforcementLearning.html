<meta name="description" content="Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex decision-making problems by combining the representation capabilities of deep learning with the decision-making power of reinforcement learning. However, learning in sparse reward environments remains challenging due to insufficient feedback to guide the optimization of agents, especially in real-life environments with high-dimensional states. To tackle this issue, experience replay is commonly introduced to enhance learning efficiency through past experiences. Nonetheless, current methods of experience replay, whether based on uniform or prioritized sampling, frequently struggle with suboptimal learning efficiency and insufficient utilization of samples. This paper proposes a novel approach, diversity-based experience replay (DBER), which leverages the deterministic point process to prioritize diverse samples in state realizations. We conducted extensive experiments on Robotic Manipulation tasks in MuJoCo, Atari games, and realistic in-door environments in Habitat. The results show that our method not only significantly improves learning efficiency but also demonstrates superior performance in sparse reward environments with high-dimensional states, providing a simple yet effective solution for this field." />

  <p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex decision-making problems by combining the representation capabilities of deep learning with the decision-making power of reinforcement learning. However, learning in sparse reward environments remains challenging due to insufficient feedback to guide the optimization of agents, especially in real-life environments with high-dimensional states. To tackle this issue, experience replay is commonly introduced to enhance learning efficiency through past experiences. Nonetheless, current methods of experience replay, whether based on uniform or prioritized sampling, frequently struggle with suboptimal learning efficiency and insufficient utilization of samples. This paper proposes a novel approach, diversity-based experience replay (DBER), which leverages the deterministic point process to prioritize diverse samples in state realizations. We conducted extensive experiments on Robotic Manipulation tasks in MuJoCo, Atari games, and realistic in-door environments in Habitat. The results show that our method not only significantly improves learning efficiency but also demonstrates superior performance in sparse reward environments with high-dimensional states, providing a simple yet effective solution for this field.</p>
