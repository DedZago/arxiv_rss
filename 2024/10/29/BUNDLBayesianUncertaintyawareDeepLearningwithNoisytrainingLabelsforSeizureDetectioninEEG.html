  <p>Deep learning methods are at the forefront of automated epileptic seizure detection and onset zone localization using scalp-EEG. However, the performance of deep learning methods rely heavily on the quality of annotated training datasets. Scalp EEG is susceptible to high noise levels, which in turn leads to imprecise annotations of the seizure timing and characteristics. This label noise presents a significant challenge in model training and generalization. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical framework that informs a deep learning model of label ambiguity, thereby enhancing the overall seizure detection performance. Our Bayesian UncertaiNty-aware Deep Learning, BUNDL, strategy offers a straightforward and model-agnostic method for training deep neural networks with noisy training labels that does not add any parameters to existing architectures. By integrating domain knowledge into the statistical framework, we derive a novel KL-divergence-based loss function that capitalizes on uncertainty to better learn seizure characteristics from scalp EEG. Additionally, we explore the impact of improved seizure detection on the task of automated onset zone localization. We validate BUNDL using a comprehensive simulated EEG dataset and two publicly available datasets, TUH and CHB-MIT. BUNDL consistently improves the performance of three base models on simulated data under seven types of label noise and three EEG signal-to-noise ratios. Similar improvements were observed in the real-world TUH and CHB-MIT datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that BUNDL improves the accuracy of seizure onset zone localization.
