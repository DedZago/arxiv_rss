<meta name="description" content="This paper considers the problem of annotating datapoints using an expert with only a few annotation rounds in a label-scarce setting. We propose soliciting reliable feedback on difficulty in annotating a datapoint from the expert in addition to ground truth label. Existing literature in active learning or coreset selection turns out to be less relevant to our setting since they presume the existence of a reliable trained model, which is absent in the label-scarce regime. However, the literature on coreset selection emphasizes the presence of difficult data points in the training set to perform supervised learning in downstream tasks (Mindermann et al., 2022). Therefore, for a given fixed annotation budget of $\mathsf{T}$ rounds, we model the sequential decision-making problem of which (difficult) datapoints to choose for annotation in a sparse linear bandits framework with the constraint that no arm can be pulled more than once (blocking constraint). With mild assumptions on the datapoints, our (computationally efficient) Explore-Then-Commit algorithm BSLB achieves a regret guarantee of $\widetilde{\mathsf{O}}(k^{\frac{1}{3}} \mathsf{T}^{\frac{2}{3}} +k^{-\frac{1}{2}} \beta_k + k^{-\frac{1}{12}} \beta_k^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathsf{T}^{\frac{5}{6}})$ where the unknown parameter vector has tail magnitude $\beta_k$ at sparsity level $k$. To this end, we show offline statistical guarantees of Lasso estimator with mild Restricted Eigenvalue (RE) condition that is also robust to sparsity. Finally, we propose a meta-algorithm C-BSLB that does not need knowledge of the optimal sparsity parameters at a no-regret cost. We demonstrate the efficacy of our BSLB algorithm for annotation in the label-scarce setting for an image classification task on the PASCAL-VOC dataset, where we use real-world annotation difficulty scores." />

  <p>This paper considers the problem of annotating datapoints using an expert with only a few annotation rounds in a label-scarce setting. We propose soliciting reliable feedback on difficulty in annotating a datapoint from the expert in addition to ground truth label. Existing literature in active learning or coreset selection turns out to be less relevant to our setting since they presume the existence of a reliable trained model, which is absent in the label-scarce regime. However, the literature on coreset selection emphasizes the presence of difficult data points in the training set to perform supervised learning in downstream tasks (Mindermann et al., 2022). Therefore, for a given fixed annotation budget of $\mathsf{T}$ rounds, we model the sequential decision-making problem of which (difficult) datapoints to choose for annotation in a sparse linear bandits framework with the constraint that no arm can be pulled more than once (blocking constraint). With mild assumptions on the datapoints, our (computationally efficient) Explore-Then-Commit algorithm BSLB achieves a regret guarantee of $\widetilde{\mathsf{O}}(k^{\frac{1}{3}} \mathsf{T}^{\frac{2}{3}} +k^{-\frac{1}{2}} \beta_k + k^{-\frac{1}{12}} \beta_k^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathsf{T}^{\frac{5}{6}})$ where the unknown parameter vector has tail magnitude $\beta_k$ at sparsity level $k$. To this end, we show offline statistical guarantees of Lasso estimator with mild Restricted Eigenvalue (RE) condition that is also robust to sparsity. Finally, we propose a meta-algorithm C-BSLB that does not need knowledge of the optimal sparsity parameters at a no-regret cost. We demonstrate the efficacy of our BSLB algorithm for annotation in the label-scarce setting for an image classification task on the PASCAL-VOC dataset, where we use real-world annotation difficulty scores.</p>
