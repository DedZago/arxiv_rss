<meta name="description" content="The rise in capability and ubiquity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has enabled its application to the field of Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs). Despite rising interest in modern AI-powered components used for real-time SIA research, substantial friction remains due to the absence of a standardized and universal SIA framework. To target this absence, we developed Estuary: a multimodal (text, audio, and soon video) framework which facilitates the development of low-latency, real-time SIAs.

  <p>The rise in capability and ubiquity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has enabled its application to the field of Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs). Despite rising interest in modern AI-powered components used for real-time SIA research, substantial friction remains due to the absence of a standardized and universal SIA framework. To target this absence, we developed Estuary: a multimodal (text, audio, and soon video) framework which facilitates the development of low-latency, real-time SIAs. Estuary seeks to reduce repeat work between studies and to provide a flexible platform that can be run entirely off-cloud to maximize configurability, controllability, reproducibility of studies, and speed of agent response times. We are able to do this by constructing a robust multimodal framework which incorporates current and future components seamlessly into a modular and interoperable architecture.</p>
