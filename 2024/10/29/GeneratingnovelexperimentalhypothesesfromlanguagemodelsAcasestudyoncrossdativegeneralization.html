  <p>Neural network language models (LMs) have been shown to successfully capture complex linguistic knowledge. However, their utility for understanding language acquisition is still debated. We contribute to this debate by presenting a case study where we use LMs as simulated learners to derive novel experimental hypotheses to be tested with humans. We apply this paradigm to study cross-dative generalization (CDG): productive generalization of novel verbs across dative constructions (she pilked me the ball/she pilked the ball to me)–acquisition of which is known to involve a large space of contextual features–using LMs trained on child-directed speech. We specifically ask: “what properties of the training exposure facilitate a novel verb’s generalization to the (unmodeled) alternate construction?” To answer this, we systematically vary the exposure context in which a novel dative verb occurs in terms of the properties of the theme and recipient, and then analyze the LMs’ usage of the novel verb in the unmodeled dative construction. We find LMs to replicate known patterns of children’s CDG, as a precondition to exploring novel hypotheses. Subsequent simulations reveal a nuanced role of the features of the novel verbs’ exposure context on the LMs’ CDG. We find CDG to be facilitated when the first postverbal argument of the exposure context is pronominal, definite, short, and conforms to the prototypical animacy expectations of the exposure dative. These patterns are characteristic of harmonic alignment in datives, where the argument with features ranking higher on the discourse prominence scale tends to precede the other. This gives rise to a novel hypothesis that CDG is facilitated insofar as the features of the exposure context–in particular, its first postverbal argument–are harmonically aligned. We conclude by proposing future experiments that can test this hypothesis in children.</p>
