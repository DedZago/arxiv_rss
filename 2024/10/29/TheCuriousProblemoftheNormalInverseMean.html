<meta name="description" content="In astronomical observations, the estimation of distances from parallaxes is a challenging task due to the inherent measurement errors and the non-linear relationship between the parallax and the distance. This study leverages ideas from robust Bayesian inference to tackle these challenges, investigating a broad class of prior densities for estimating distances with a reduced bias and variance. Through theoretical analysis, simulation experiments, and the application to data from the Gaia Data Release 1 (GDR1), we demonstrate that heavy-tailed priors provide more reliable distance estimates, particularly in the presence of large fractional parallax errors. Theoretical results highlight the “curse of a single observation,” where the likelihood dominates the posterior, limiting the impact of the prior.

  <p>In astronomical observations, the estimation of distances from parallaxes is a challenging task due to the inherent measurement errors and the non-linear relationship between the parallax and the distance. This study leverages ideas from robust Bayesian inference to tackle these challenges, investigating a broad class of prior densities for estimating distances with a reduced bias and variance. Through theoretical analysis, simulation experiments, and the application to data from the Gaia Data Release 1 (GDR1), we demonstrate that heavy-tailed priors provide more reliable distance estimates, particularly in the presence of large fractional parallax errors. Theoretical results highlight the “curse of a single observation,” where the likelihood dominates the posterior, limiting the impact of the prior. Nevertheless, heavy-tailed priors can delay the explosion of posterior risk, offering a more robust framework for distance estimation. The findings suggest that reciprocal invariant priors, with polynomial decay in their tails, such as the Half-Cauchy and Product Half-Cauchy, are particularly well-suited for this task, providing a balance between bias reduction and variance control.</p>
