  <h1>Hierarchical Network Partitioning for Solution of Potential-Driven, Steady-State Nonlinear Network Flow Equations</h1>

  <br> []

  <p>Potential-driven steady-state flow in networks is an abstract problem which manifests in various engineering applications, such as transport of natural gas, water, electric power through infrastructure networks or flow through fractured rocks modelled as discrete fracture networks. In general, while the problem is simple when restricted to a single edge of a network, it ceases to be so for a large network.
  The resultant system of nonlinear equations depends on the network topology and in general there is no numerical algorithm that offers guaranteed convergence to the solution (assuming a solution exists). Some methods offer guarantees in cases where the network topology satisfies certain assumptions but these methods fail for larger networks. On the other hand, the Newton-Raphson algorithm offers a convergence guarantee if the starting point lies close to the (unknown) solution.
  It would be advantageous to compute the solution of the large nonlinear system through the solution of smaller nonlinear sub-systems wherein the solution algorithms (Newton-Raphson or otherwise) are more likely to succeed. This article proposes and describes such a procedure, an hierarchical network partitioning algorithm that enables the solution of large nonlinear systems corresponding to potential-driven steady-state network flow equations.</p>
