In this paper, we introduce UniMTS, the first unified pre-training procedure for motion time series that generalizes across diverse device latent factors and activities. Specifically, we employ a contrastive learning framework that aligns motion time series with text descriptions enriched by large language models.

Spatio-temporal graph networks are utilized to capture the relationships across joints for generalization across different device locations.
