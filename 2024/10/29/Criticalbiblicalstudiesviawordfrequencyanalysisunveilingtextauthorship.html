  <p>The Bible, a product of an extensive and intricate process of oral-written transmission spanning centuries, obscures the contours of its earlier recensions. Debate rages over determining the existing layers and identifying the date of composition and historical background of the biblical texts. Traditional manual methodologies have grappled with authorship challenges through scrupulous textual criticism, employing linguistic, stylistic, inner-biblical, and historical criteria. Despite recent progress in computer-assisted analysis, many patterns still need to be uncovered in Biblical Texts.
