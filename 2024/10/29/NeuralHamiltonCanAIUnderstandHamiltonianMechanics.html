  <p>We propose a novel framework based on neural network that reformulates classical mechanics as an operator learning problem. A machine directly maps a potential function to its corresponding trajectory in phase space without solving the Hamilton equations. Most notably, while conventional methods tend to accumulate errors over time through iterative time integration, our approach prevents error propagation. Two newly developed neural network architectures, namely VaRONet and MambONet, are introduced to adapt the Variational LSTM sequence-to-sequence model and leverage the Mamba model for efficient temporal dynamics processing. We tested our approach with various 1D physics problems: harmonic oscillation, double-well potentials, Morse potential, and other potential models outside the training data. Compared to traditional numerical methods based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) algorithm, our model demonstrates improved computational efficiency and accuracy.
