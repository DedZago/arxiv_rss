  <p>This paper introduces a novel decomposition framework to explain heterogeneity in causal effects observed across different studies, considering both observational and randomized settings. We present a formal decomposition of between-study heterogeneity, identifying sources of variability in treatment effects across studies. The proposed methodology allows for robust estimation of causal parameters under various assumptions, addressing differences in pre-treatment covariate distributions, mediating variables, and the outcome mechanism. Our approach is validated through a simulation study and applied to data from the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study, demonstrating its practical relevance. This work contributes to the broader understanding of causal inference in multi-study environments, with potential applications in evidence synthesis and policy-making.</p>
