  <p>Multivariate spatial disease mapping has become a pivotal part of everyday practice in social epidemiology. Despite the existence of several specifications for the relation between different outcomes, there is still a need for a new strategy that focuses on comparing the spatial risk patterns of different subgroups of the population. This paper introduces a new approach for detecting differences in spatial risk patterns between different populations at risk, using suicide-related emergency calls to study suicide risks in the Valencian Community (Spain).</p>
