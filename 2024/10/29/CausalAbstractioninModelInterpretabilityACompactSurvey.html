  <h1>Causal Abstraction in Model Interpretability: A Compact Survey</h1>
  <br>Yihao Zhang</h3>
  <br> []

  <p>The pursuit of interpretable artificial intelligence has led to significant advancements in the development of methods that aim to explain the decision-making processes of complex models, such as deep learning systems. Among these methods, causal abstraction stands out as a theoretical framework that provides a principled approach to understanding and explaining the causal mechanisms underlying model behavior. This survey paper delves into the realm of causal abstraction, examining its theoretical foundations, practical applications, and implications for the field of model interpretability.</p>
