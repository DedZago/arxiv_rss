<meta name="description" content="Landmine detection using traditional methods is slow, dangerous and prohibitively expensive. Using deep learning-based object detection algorithms drone videos is promising but has multiple challenges due to the small, soda-can size of recently prevalent surface landmines. The literature currently lacks scientific evaluation of optimal ML models for this problem since most object detection research focuses on analysis of ground video surveillance images. In order to help train comprehensive models and drive research for surface landmine detection, we first create a custom dataset comprising drone images of POM-2 and POM-3 Russian surface landmines. Using this dataset, we train, test and compare 4 different computer vision foundation models YOLOF, DETR, Sparse-RCNN and VFNet. Generally, all 4 detectors do well with YOLOF outperforming other models with a mAP score of 0.89 while DETR, VFNET and Sparse-RCNN mAP scores are all around 0.82 for drone images taken from 10m AGL. YOLOF is also quicker to train consuming 56min of training time on a Nvidia V100 compute cluster. Finally, this research contributes landmine image, video datasets and model Jupyter notebooks at https://github.com/UnVeilX/ to enable future research in surface landmine detection." />

  <p>Landmine detection using traditional methods is slow, dangerous and prohibitively expensive. Using deep learning-based object detection algorithms drone videos is promising but has multiple challenges due to the small, soda-can size of recently prevalent surface landmines. The literature currently lacks scientific evaluation of optimal ML models for this problem since most object detection research focuses on analysis of ground video surveillance images. In order to help train comprehensive models and drive research for surface landmine detection, we first create a custom dataset comprising drone images of POM-2 and POM-3 Russian surface landmines. Using this dataset, we train, test and compare 4 different computer vision foundation models YOLOF, DETR, Sparse-RCNN and VFNet.
