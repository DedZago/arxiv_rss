<meta name="description" content="In recent years, Artificial intelligence (AI) has become ubiquitous, empowering various fields, especially integrating artificial intelligence and traditional science (AI for Science: Artificial intelligence for science), which has attracted widespread attention. In AI for Science, using artificial intelligence algorithms to solve partial differential equations (AI for PDEs: Artificial intelligence for partial differential equations) has become a focal point in computational mechanics. The core of AI for PDEs is the fusion of data and partial differential equations (PDEs), which can solve almost any PDEs.

AI for PDEs represents a new method of scientific simulation that provides approximate solutions to specific problems using large amounts of data, then fine-tuning according to specific physical laws, avoiding the need to compute from scratch like traditional algorithms.

The core of AI for PDEs is the fusion of data and partial differential equations (PDEs), which can solve almost any PDEs. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive review of the research on AI for PDEs, summarizing the existing algorithms and theories.
