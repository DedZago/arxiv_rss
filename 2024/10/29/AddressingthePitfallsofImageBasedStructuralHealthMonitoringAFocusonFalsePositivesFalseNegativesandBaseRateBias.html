<meta name="description" content="This study explores the limitations of image-based structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques in detecting structural damage. Leveraging machine learning and computer vision, image-based SHM offers a scalable and efficient alternative to manual inspections. However, its reliability is impacted by challenges such as false positives, false negatives, and environmental variability, particularly in low base rate damage scenarios. The Base Rate Bias plays a significant role, as low probabilities of actual damage often lead to misinterpretation of positive results. This study uses both Bayesian analysis and a frequentist approach to evaluate the precision of damage detection systems, revealing that even highly accurate models can yield misleading results when the occurrence of damage is rare. Strategies for mitigating these limitations are discussed, including hybrid systems that combine multiple data sources, human-in-the-loop approaches for critical assessments, and improving the quality of training data. These findings provide essential insights into the practical applicability of image-based SHM techniques, highlighting both their potential and their limitations for real-world infrastructure monitoring." />

  <p>This study explores the limitations of image-based structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques in detecting structural damage. Leveraging machine learning and computer vision, image-based SHM offers a scalable and efficient alternative to manual inspections. However, its reliability is impacted by challenges such as false positives, false negatives, and environmental variability, particularly in low base rate damage scenarios. The Base Rate Bias plays a significant role, as low probabilities of actual damage often lead to misinterpretation of positive results. This study uses both Bayesian analysis and a frequentist approach to evaluate the precision of damage detection systems, revealing that even highly accurate models can yield misleading results when the occurrence of damage is rare. Strategies for mitigating these limitations are discussed, including hybrid systems that combine multiple data sources, human-in-the-loop approaches for critical assessments, and improving the quality of training data. These findings provide essential insights into the practical applicability of image-based SHM techniques, highlighting both their potential and their limitations for real-world infrastructure monitoring.</p>
