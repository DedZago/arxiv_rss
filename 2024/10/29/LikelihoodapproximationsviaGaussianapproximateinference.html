  <p>Non-Gaussian likelihoods are essential for modelling complex real-world observations but pose significant computational challenges in learning and inference. Even with Gaussian priors, non-Gaussian likelihoods often lead to analytically intractable posteriors, necessitating approximation methods. To this end, we propose efficient schemes to approximate the effects of non-Gaussian likelihoods by Gaussian densities based on variational inference and moment matching in transformed bases. These enable efficient inference strategies originally designed for models with a Gaussian likelihood to be deployed. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed matching strategies attain good approximation quality for binary and multiclass classification in large-scale point-estimate and distributional inferential settings. In challenging streaming problems, the proposed methods outperform all existing likelihood approximations and approximate inference methods in the exact models. As a by-product, we show that the proposed approximate log-likelihoods are a superior alternative to least-squares on raw labels for neural network classification.</p>
