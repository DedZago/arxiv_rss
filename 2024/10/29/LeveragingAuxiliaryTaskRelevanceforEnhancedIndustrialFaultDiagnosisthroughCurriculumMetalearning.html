  <p>The accurate diagnosis of machine breakdowns is crucial for maintaining operational safety in smart manufacturing. Despite the promise shown by deep learning in automating fault identification, the scarcity of labeled training data, particularly for equipment failure instances, poses a significant challenge. This limitation hampers the development of robust classification models. Existing methods like model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) do not adequately address variable working conditions, affecting knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, a Related Task Aware Curriculum Meta-learning (RT-ACM) enhanced fault diagnosis framework is proposed in this paper, inspired by human cognitive learning processes. RT-ACM improves training by considering the relevance of auxiliary working conditions, adhering to the principle of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">paying more attention to more relevant knowledge", and focusing on</code>easier first, harder later” curriculum sampling. This approach aids the meta-learner in achieving a superior convergence state. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of RT-ACM framework.</p>
