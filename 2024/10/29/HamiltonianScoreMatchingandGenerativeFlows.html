  <p>Classical Hamiltonian mechanics has been widely used in machine learning in the form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for applications with predetermined force fields. In this work, we explore the potential of deliberately designing force fields for Hamiltonian ODEs, introducing Hamiltonian velocity predictors (HVPs) as a tool for score matching and generative models. We present two innovations constructed with HVPs: Hamiltonian Score Matching (HSM), which estimates score functions by augmenting data via Hamiltonian trajectories, and Hamiltonian Generative Flows (HGFs), a novel generative model that encompasses diffusion models and flow matching as HGFs with zero force fields. We showcase the extended design space of force fields by introducing Oscillation HGFs, a generative model inspired by harmonic oscillators. Our experiments validate our theoretical insights about HSM as a novel score matching metric and demonstrate that HGFs rival leading generative modeling techniques.</p>
