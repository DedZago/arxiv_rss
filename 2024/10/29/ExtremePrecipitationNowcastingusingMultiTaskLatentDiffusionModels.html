<meta name="description" content="Deep learning models have made remarkable strides in precipitation prediction, yet they continue to struggle with capturing the spatial details of the features of radar images, particularly over high precipitation intensity areas. This shortcoming is evident in the form of low forecast accuracy in the spatial positioning of radar echo images across varying precipitation intensity regions. To address this challenge, we introduce the multi-task latent diffusion model(MTLDM), a novel approach for precipitation prediction. The basic concept of the MTLDM is based on the understanding that the radar image representing precipitation is the result of multiple factors. Therefore, we adopt a divide-and-conquer approach, that is, we decompose the radar image using decomposition technology and then predict the decomposed sub-images separately. We conceptualize the precipitation image as a composition of various components corresponding to different precipitation intensities. The MTLDM decomposes the precipitation image into these distinct components and employs a dedicated task to predict each one. This method enables spatiotemporally consistent prediction of real-world precipitation areas up to 5-80 min in advance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple evaluation metrics." />

  <p>Deep learning models have made remarkable strides in precipitation prediction, yet they continue to struggle with capturing the spatial details of the features of radar images, particularly over high precipitation intensity areas. This shortcoming is evident in the form of low forecast accuracy in the spatial positioning of radar echo images across varying precipitation intensity regions. To address this challenge, we introduce the multi-task latent diffusion model(MTLDM), a novel approach for precipitation prediction. The basic concept of the MTLDM is based on the understanding that the radar image representing precipitation is the result of multiple factors. Therefore, we adopt a divide-and-conquer approach, that is, we decompose the radar image using decomposition technology and then predict the decomposed sub-images separately. We conceptualize the precipitation image as a composition of various components corresponding to different precipitation intensities. The MTLDM decomposes the precipitation image into these distinct components and employs a dedicated task to predict each one. This method enables spatiotemporally consistent prediction of real-world precipitation areas up to 5-80 min in advance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple evaluation metrics.</p>
