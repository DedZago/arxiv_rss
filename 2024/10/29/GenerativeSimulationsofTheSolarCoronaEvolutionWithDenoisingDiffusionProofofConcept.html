  <p>The solar magnetized corona is responsible for various manifestations with a space weather impact, such as flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and, naturally, the solar wind. Modeling the corona’s dynamics and evolution is therefore critical for improving our ability to predict space weather In this work, we demonstrate that generative deep learning methods, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), can be successfully applied to simulate future evolutions of the corona as observed in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. Our model takes a 12-hour video of an Active Region (AR) as input and simulate the potential evolution of the AR over the subsequent 12 hours, with a time-resolution of two hours.
