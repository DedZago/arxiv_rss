  <p>In this work, we first present an adaptive deterministic block coordinate descent method with momentum (mADBCD) to solve the linear least-squares problem, which is based on Polyak’s heavy ball method and a new column selection criterion for a set of block-controlled indices defined by the Euclidean norm of the residual vector of the normal equation. The mADBCD method eliminates the need for pre-partitioning the column indexes of the coefficient matrix, and it also obviates the need to compute the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of a column sub-matrix at each iteration. Moreover, we demonstrate the adaptability and flexibility in the automatic selection and updating of the block control index set. When the coefficient matrix has full rank, the theoretical analysis of the mADBCD method indicates that it linearly converges towards the unique solution of the linear least-squares problem. Furthermore, by effectively integrating count sketch technology with the mADBCD method, we also propose a novel count sketch adaptive block coordinate descent method with momentum (CS-mADBCD) for solving highly overdetermined linear least-squares problems and analysis its convergence. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate the advantages of the proposed two methods in terms of both CPU times and iteration counts compared to recent block coordinate descent methods.</p>
