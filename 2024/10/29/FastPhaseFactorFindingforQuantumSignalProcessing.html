  <br> []

  <p>This paper presents two efficient and stable algorithms for recovering phase factors in quantum signal processing (QSP), a crucial component of many quantum algorithms. The first algorithm, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Half Cholesky" method, which is based on nonlinear Fourier analysis and fast solvers for structured matrices, demonstrates robust performance across all regimes. The second algorithm,</code>Fast Fixed Point Iteration,” provides even greater efficiency in the non-fully-coherent regime. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate the significant advantages of these new methods over all existing approaches.</p>
