<meta name="description" content="Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have become a pivotal method in machine learning for modeling functions over graphs. Despite their widespread success across various applications, their statistical properties (e.g. consistency, convergence rates) remain ill-characterized. To begin addressing this knowledge gap, in this paper, we provide a formal analysis of the impact of convolution operators on regression tasks over homophilic networks. Focusing on estimators based solely on neighborhood aggregation, we examine how two common convolutions - the original GCN and GraphSage convolutions - affect the learning error as a function of the neighborhood topology and the number of convolutional layers. We explicitly characterize the bias-variance trade-off incurred by GCNs as a function of the neighborhood size and identify specific graph topologies where convolution operators are less effective. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by synthetic experiments, and provide a start to a deeper quantitative understanding of convolutional effects in GCNs for offering rigorous guidelines for practitioners." />

  <p>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have become a pivotal method in machine learning for modeling functions over graphs. Despite their widespread success across various applications, their statistical properties (e.g. consistency, convergence rates) remain ill-characterized. To begin addressing this knowledge gap, in this paper, we provide a formal analysis of the impact of convolution operators on regression tasks over homophilic networks. Focusing on estimators based solely on neighborhood aggregation, we examine how two common convolutions - the original GCN and GraphSage convolutions - affect the learning error as a function of the neighborhood topology and the number of convolutional layers. We explicitly characterize the bias-variance trade-off incurred by GCNs as a function of the neighborhood size and identify specific graph topologies where convolution operators are less effective. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by synthetic experiments, and provide a start to a deeper quantitative understanding of convolutional effects in GCNs for offering rigorous guidelines for practitioners.</p>
