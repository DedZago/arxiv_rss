<meta name="description" content="Radio-Frequency (RF)-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) rises as a promising solution for applications unamenable to techniques requiring computer visions. However, the scarcity of labeled RF data due to their non-interpretable nature poses a significant obstacle. Thanks to the recent breakthrough of foundation models (FMs), extracting deep semantic insights from unlabeled visual data become viable, yet these vision-based FMs fall short when applied to small RF datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce FM-Fi, an innovative cross-modal framework engineered to translate the knowledge of vision-based FMs for enhancing RF-based HAR systems. FM-Fi involves a novel cross-modal contrastive knowledge distillation mechanism, enabling an RF encoder to inherit the interpretative power of FMs for achieving zero-shot learning. It also employs the intrinsic capabilities of FM and RF to remove extraneous features for better alignment between the two modalities. The framework is further refined through metric-based few-shot learning techniques, aiming to boost the performance for predefined HAR tasks. Comprehensive evaluations evidently indicate that FM-Fi rivals the effectiveness of vision-based methodologies, and the evaluation results provide empirical validation of FM-Fi’s generalizability across various environments." />

  <p>Radio-Frequency (RF)-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) rises as a promising solution for applications unamenable to techniques requiring computer visions.

Thanks to the recent breakthrough of foundation models (FMs), extracting deep semantic insights from unlabeled visual data become viable, yet these vision-based FMs fall short when applied to small RF datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce FM-Fi, an innovative cross-modal framework engineered to translate the knowledge of vision-based FMs for enhancing RF-based HAR systems. FM-Fi involves a novel cross-modal contrastive knowledge distillation mechanism, enabling an RF encoder to inherit the interpretative power of FMs for achieving zero-shot learning.
