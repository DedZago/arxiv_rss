<meta name="description" content="This study addresses the deployment challenges of integer-only quantized Transformers on resource-constrained embedded FPGAs (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15). We enhanced the flexibility of our VHDL template by introducing a selectable resource type for storing intermediate results across model layers, thereby breaking the deployment bottleneck by utilizing BRAM efficiently. Moreover, we developed a resource-aware mixed-precision quantization approach that enables researchers to explore hardware-level quantization strategies without requiring extensive expertise in Neural Architecture Search. This method provides accurate resource utilization estimates with a precision discrepancy as low as 3%, compared to actual deployment metrics. Compared to previous work, our approach has successfully facilitated the deployment of model configurations utilizing mixed-precision quantization, thus overcoming the limitations inherent in five previously non-deployable configurations with uniform quantization bitwidths. Consequently, this research enhances the applicability of Transformers in embedded systems, facilitating a broader range of Transformer-powered applications on edge devices." />

  <p>This study addresses the deployment challenges of integer-only quantized Transformers on resource-constrained embedded FPGAs (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15). We enhanced the flexibility of our VHDL template by introducing a selectable resource type for storing intermediate results across model layers, thereby breaking the deployment bottleneck by utilizing BRAM efficiently. Moreover, we developed a resource-aware mixed-precision quantization approach that enables researchers to explore hardware-level quantization strategies without requiring extensive expertise in Neural Architecture Search. This method provides accurate resource utilization estimates with a precision discrepancy as low as 3%, compared to actual deployment metrics. Compared to previous work, our approach has successfully facilitated the deployment of model configurations utilizing mixed-precision quantization, thus overcoming the limitations inherent in five previously non-deployable configurations with uniform quantization bitwidths. Consequently, this research enhances the applicability of Transformers in embedded systems, facilitating a broader range of Transformer-powered applications on edge devices.</p>
