  <p>This paper presents a novel learning-based approach for online estimation of maximal safe sets for local motion planning tasks in mobile robotics. We leverage the idea of hypernetworks to achieve good generalization properties and real-time performance simultaneously. As the source of supervision, we employ the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, allowing us to consider general nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary constraints. We integrate our model into a model predictive control (MPC) local planner as a safety constraint and compare the performance with relevant baselines in realistic 3D simulations for different environments and robot dynamics. The results show the advantages of our approach in terms of a significantly higher success rate: 2 to 18 percent over the best baseline, while achieving real-time performance.</p>
