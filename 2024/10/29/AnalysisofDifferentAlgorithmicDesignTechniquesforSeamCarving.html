<meta name="description" content="Seam carving, a content-aware image resizing technique, has garnered significant attention for its ability to resize images while preserving important content. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of four algorithmic design techniques for seam carving: brute-force, greedy, dynamic programming, and GPU-based parallel algorithms. We begin by presenting a theoretical overview of each technique, discussing their underlying principles and computational complexities. Subsequently, we delve into empirical evaluations, comparing the performance of these algorithms in terms of runtime efficiency. Our experimental results provide insights into the theoretical complexities of the design techniques." />

  <p>Seam carving, a content-aware image resizing technique, has garnered significant attention for its ability to resize images while preserving important content. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of four algorithmic design techniques for seam carving: brute-force, greedy, dynamic programming, and GPU-based parallel algorithms. We begin by presenting a theoretical overview of each technique, discussing their underlying principles and computational complexities. Subsequently, we delve into empirical evaluations, comparing the performance of these algorithms in terms of runtime efficiency. Our experimental results provide insights into the theoretical complexities of the design techniques.</p>
