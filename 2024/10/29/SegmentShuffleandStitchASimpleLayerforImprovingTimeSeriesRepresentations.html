  <p>Existing approaches for learning representations of time-series keep the temporal arrangement of the time-steps intact with the presumption that the original order is the most optimal for learning. However, non-adjacent sections of real-world time-series may have strong dependencies. Accordingly, we raise the question: Is there an alternative arrangement for time-series which could enable more effective representation learning? To address this, we propose a simple plug-and-play neural network layer called Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch (S3) designed to improve representation learning by time-series models. S3 works by creating non-overlapping segments from the original sequence and shuffling them in a learned manner that is optimal for the task at hand. It then re-attaches the shuffled segments back together and performs a learned weighted sum with the original input to capture both the newly shuffled sequence along with the original sequence. S3 is modular and can be stacked to achieve different levels of granularity, and can be added to many forms of neural architectures including CNNs or Transformers with negligible computation overhead. Through extensive experiments on several datasets and state-of-the-art baselines, we show that incorporating S3 results in significant improvements for the tasks of time-series classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection, improving performance on certain datasets by up to 68\%. We also show that S3 makes the learning more stable with a smoother training loss curve and loss landscape compared to the original baseline.
