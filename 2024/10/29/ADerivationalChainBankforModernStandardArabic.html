  <p>This study presents the ``Arabic Derivational ChainBank,’’ a novel framework for modeling Arabic derivational morphology. It establishes connections between forms and meanings by constructing a chain of derived words that reflect their derivational significance. To expedite the process, a rule-based methodology was employed, avoiding time-consuming manual annotation. The derivational network was then aligned with the CamelMorph morphological analyzer database. This two-step process resulted in a chain of derived word lemmas linked to their roots, encompassing 23,333 evaluated derivational relations, thereby demonstrating the efficiency of the ChainBank.</p>
