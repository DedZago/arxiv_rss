<meta name="description" content="This paper aims to simultaneously optimize indoor wireless and daylight performance by adjusting the positions of windows and the beam directions of window-deployed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for RIS-aided outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) networks utilizing large language models (LLM) as optimizers. Firstly, we illustrate the wireless and daylight system models of RIS-aided O2I networks and formulate a joint optimization problem to enhance both wireless traffic sum rate and daylight illumination performance. Then, we present a multi-modal LLM-based window optimization (LMWO) framework, accompanied by a prompt construction template to optimize the overall performance in a zero-shot fashion, functioning as both an architect and a wireless network planner. Finally, we analyze the optimization performance of the LMWO framework and the impact of the number of windows, room size, number of RIS units, and daylight factor. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed LMWO framework can achieve outstanding optimization performance in terms of initial performance, convergence speed, final outcomes, and time complexity, compared with classic optimization methods. The building’s wireless performance can be significantly enhanced while ensuring indoor daylight performance." />
