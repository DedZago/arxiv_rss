  <p>The quest for simplification in physics drives the exploration of concise mathematical representations for complex systems. This Dissertation focuses on the concept of dimensionality reduction as a means to obtain low-dimensional descriptions from high-dimensional data, facilitating comprehension and analysis. We address the challenges posed by real-world data that defy conventional assumptions, such as complex interactions within neural systems or high-dimensional dynamical systems. Leveraging insights from both theoretical physics and machine learning, this work unifies diverse reduction methods under a comprehensive framework, the Deep Variational Multivariate Information Bottleneck.
