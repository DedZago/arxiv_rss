  <p>In this work, we propose Asynchronous Perception Machine (APM), a computationally-efficient architecture for test-time-training (TTT). APM can process patches of an image one at a time in any order \textit{asymmetrically,} and \textit{still encode} semantic-awareness in the net. We demonstrate APM’s ability to recognize out-of-distribution images \textit{without} dataset-specific pre-training, augmentation or any-pretext task. APM offers competitive performance over existing TTT approaches. To perform TTT, APM just distills test sample’s representation \textit{once}. APM possesses a unique property: it can learn using just this single representation and starts predicting semantically-aware features.
  APM demostrates potential applications beyond test-time-training: APM can scale up to a dataset of 2D images and yield semantic-clusterings in a single forward pass. APM also provides first empirical evidence towards validating GLOM’s insight, i.e. input percept is a field. Therefore, APM helps us converge towards an implementation which can do \textit{both} interpolation and perception on a \textit{shared}-connectionist hardware.
