  <p>User grouping based on geographic location in fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR) systems has several applications that can significantly improve network performance, user experience, and service delivery. We demonstrate how Sounding Reference Signals channel fingerprints can be used for dynamic user grouping in a 5G NR commercial deployment based on outdoor positions and heading direction employing machine learning methods such as neural networks combined with clustering methods.</p>
