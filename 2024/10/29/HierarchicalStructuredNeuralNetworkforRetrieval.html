Despite the recent rise to popularity in the industry, they have a couple of limitations. Firstly, Two Tower model architecture uses a single dot product interaction which despite their efficiency fail to capture the data distribution in practice.

We achieve 6.5% improvement in offline evaluation and also demonstrate 1.22% online gains through A/B experiments. HSNN has been successfully deployed into the Ads Recommendation system and is currently handling major portion of the traffic.
