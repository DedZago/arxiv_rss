  <h1>A quantum graph FFT with applications to partial differential equations on networks</h1>
  <br>Robert Carlson</h3>
  <br> []

  <p>Many natural and manufactured structures can be effectively modeled as networks of one dimensional segments joined at nodes. A new algorithm for the numerical solution of various time dependent partial differential equations on some of these networks is presented. The main novelty is a network version of the Fast Fourier Transform, which provides an efficient technique for expansions with eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator.</p>
