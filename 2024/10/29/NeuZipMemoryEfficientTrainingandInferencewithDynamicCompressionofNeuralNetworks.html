  <p>The performance of neural networks improves when more parameters are used. However, the model sizes are constrained by the available on-device memory during training and inference. Although applying techniques like quantization can alleviate the constraint, they suffer from performance degradation. In this work, we introduce NeuZip, a new weight compression scheme based on the entropy of floating-point numbers in neural networks. With NeuZip, we are able to achieve memory-efficient training and inference without sacrificing performance. Notably, we significantly reduce the memory footprint of training a Llama-3 8B model from 31GB to less than 16GB, while keeping the training dynamics fully unchanged. In inference, our method can reduce memory usage by more than half while maintaining near-lossless performance. Our code is publicly available.</p>
