<meta name="description" content="Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in natural language processing, enabling advanced data analytics through natural language queries. However, these models often generate “hallucinations”-inaccurate or fabricated information-that can undermine their reliability in critical data-driven decision-making. Addressing the challenge of hallucinations is essential to improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLMs in processing natural language queries. This research focuses on mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, specifically within the context of data analytics. We introduce and evaluate four targeted strategies: Structured Output Generation, Strict Rules Enforcement, System Prompt Enhancements, and Semantic Layer Integration. Our findings show that these methods are more effective than traditional fine-tuning approaches in reducing hallucinations, offering a more reliable framework for deploying LLMs in natural language queries for data analytics. This research demonstrates the potential of these strategies to enhance the accuracy of LLM-driven data queries, ensuring more dependable results in data-driven environments." />

  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in natural language processing, enabling advanced data analytics through natural language queries. However, these models often generate “hallucinations”-inaccurate or fabricated information-that can undermine their reliability in critical data-driven decision-making. Addressing the challenge of hallucinations is essential to improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLMs in processing natural language queries. This research focuses on mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, specifically within the context of data analytics. We introduce and evaluate four targeted strategies: Structured Output Generation, Strict Rules Enforcement, System Prompt Enhancements, and Semantic Layer Integration. Our findings show that these methods are more effective than traditional fine-tuning approaches in reducing hallucinations, offering a more reliable framework for deploying LLMs in natural language queries for data analytics. This research demonstrates the potential of these strategies to enhance the accuracy of LLM-driven data queries, ensuring more dependable results in data-driven environments.</p>
