  <p>This work introduces an unconventional inexact augmented Lagrangian method, where the augmenting term is a Euclidean norm raised to a power between one and two. The proposed algorithm is applicable to a broad class of constrained nonconvex minimization problems, that involve nonlinear equality constraints over a convex set under a mild regularity condition. First, we conduct a full complexity analysis of the method, leveraging an accelerated first-order algorithm for solving the H"older-smooth subproblems. Next, we present an inexact proximal point method to tackle these subproblems, demonstrating that it achieves an improved convergence rate. Notably, this rate reduces to the best-known convergence rate for first-order methods when the augmenting term is a squared Euclidean norm. Our worst-case complexity results further show that using lower powers for the augmenting term leads to faster constraint satisfaction, albeit with a slower decrease in the dual residual. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings, illustrating that this trade-off between constraint satisfaction and cost minimization is advantageous for certain practical problems.</p>
