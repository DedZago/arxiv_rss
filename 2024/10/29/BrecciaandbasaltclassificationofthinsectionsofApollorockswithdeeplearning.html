  <p>Human exploration of the moon is expected to resume in the next decade, following the last such activities in the Apollo programme time. One of the major objectives of returning to the Moon is to continue retrieving geological samples, with a focus on collecting high-quality specimens to maximize scientific return. Tools that assist astronauts in making informed decisions about sample collection activities can maximize the scientific value of future lunar missions. A lunar rock classifier is a tool that can potentially provide the necessary information for astronauts to analyze lunar rock samples, allowing them to augment in-situ value identification of samples.
