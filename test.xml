      <title>Conformal online model aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction equips machine learning models with a reasonable notion of uncertainty quantification without making strong distributional assumptions. It wraps around any black-box prediction model and converts point predictions into set predictions that have a predefined marginal coverage guarantee. However, conformal prediction only works if we fix the underlying machine learning model in advance. A relatively unaddressed issue in conformal prediction is that of model selection and/or aggregation: for a given problem, which of the plethora of prediction methods (random forests, neural nets, regularized linear models, etc.) should we conformalize? This paper proposes a new approach towards conformal model aggregation in online settings that is based on combining the prediction sets from several algorithms by voting, where weights on the models are adapted over time based on past performance.</description>

      <title>Computationally Scalable Bayesian SPDE Modeling for Censored Spatial Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of groundwater pollutants, such as arsenic or Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), are riddled with left censoring. These measurements have impact on the health and lifestyle of the populace. Left censoring of these spatially correlated observations are usually addressed by applying Gaussian processes (GPs), which have theoretical advantages. However, this comes with a challenging computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, which is impractical for large datasets. Additionally, a sizable proportion of the data being left-censored creates further bottlenecks, since the likelihood computation now involves an intractable high-dimensional integral of the multivariate Gaussian density. In this article, we tackle these two problems simultaneously by approximating the GP with a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) approach that exploits an explicit link between a GP with Mat\'ern correlation function and a GMRF using stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). We introduce a GMRF-based measurement error into the model, which alleviates the likelihood computation for the censored data, drastically improving the speed of the model while maintaining admirable accuracy. Our approach demonstrates robustness and substantial computational scalability, compared to state-of-the-art methods for censored spatial responses across various simulation settings. Finally, the fit of this fully Bayesian model to the concentration of PFOS in groundwater available at 24,959 sites across California, where 46.62\% responses are censored, produces prediction surface and uncertainty quantification in real time, thereby substantiating the applicability and scalability of the proposed method. Code for implementation is made available via GitHub.</description>

      <title>Reducing Investigator Bias in Sampling-Based Land Cover Classification by Integrating Multiple Investigators' Maps Using a Multiple Classifier System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Land cover classification plays a pivotal role in describing Earth's surface characteristics. However, these thematic classifications can be affected by uncertainties introduced by an investigator's bias. While land cover classification mapping is becoming easier for us due to the emergence of cloud geospatial platforms such as Google Earth Engine, such uncertainty is often overlooked. Thus, this study aimed to create a robust land cover classification map by reducing investigator-induced uncertainty from independent investigators' maps using a multiple classifier system. In Saitama City, Japan, as a case study, 44 investigators used a point-based visual interpretation method via Google Earth Engine to collect stratified reference samples across four different land cover classes: forest, agriculture, urban, and water. These samples were then used to train a random forest classifier, ultimately resulting in the creation of individual classification maps. We quantified pixel-level discrepancies in these maps, which came from inherent investigator-induced variability. To tackle these uncertainties, we developed a multiple classifier system incorporating K-Medoids to group the most reliable maps and minimize discrepancies. We further applied Bayesian analysis to these grouped maps to produce a unified, accurate classification map. This yielded an overall accuracy of 92.5\% for 400 independent validation samples. We discuss how our approach can also reduce salt-and-pepper noise, which is often found in individual classification maps. This research underscores the intrinsic uncertainties present in land cover classification maps attributable to investigator variations and introduces a potential solution to attenuate these variations.</description>

      <title>Optimized Model Selection for Estimating Treatment Effects from Costly Simulations of the US Opioid Epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based simulation with a synthetic population can help us compare different treatment conditions while keeping everything else constant within the same population (i.e., as digital twins). Such population-scale simulations require large computational power (i.e., CPU resources) to get accurate estimates for treatment effects. We can use meta models of the simulation results to circumvent the need to simulate every treatment condition. Selecting the best estimating model at a given sample size (number of simulation runs) is a crucial problem. Depending on the sample size, the ability of the method to estimate accurately can change significantly. In this paper, we discuss different methods to explore what model works best at a specific sample size. In addition to the empirical results, we provide a mathematical analysis of the MSE equation and how its components decide which model to select and why a specific method behaves that way in a range of sample sizes. The analysis showed why the direction estimation method is better than model-based methods in larger sample sizes and how the between-group variation and the within-group variation affect the MSE equation.</description>

      <title>Supervised Learning via Ensembles of Diverse Functional Representations: the Functional Voting Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many conventional statistical and machine learning methods face challenges when applied directly to high dimensional temporal observations. In recent decades, Functional Data Analysis (FDA) has gained widespread popularity as a framework for modeling and analyzing data that are, by their nature, functions in the domain of time. Although supervised classification has been extensively explored in recent decades within the FDA literature, ensemble learning of functional classifiers has only recently emerged as a topic of significant interest. Thus, the latter subject presents unexplored facets and challenges from various statistical perspectives. The focal point of this paper lies in the realm of ensemble learning for functional data and aims to show how different functional data representations can be used to train ensemble members and how base model predictions can be combined through majority voting. The so-called Functional Voting Classifier (FVC) is proposed to demonstrate how different functional representations leading to augmented diversity can increase predictive accuracy. Many real-world datasets from several domains are used to display that the FVC can significantly enhance performance compared to individual models. The framework presented provides a foundation for voting ensembles with functional data and can stimulate a highly encouraging line of research in the FDA context.</description>

      <title>Reviving pseudo-inverses: Asymptotic properties of large dimensional Moore-Penrose and Ridge-type inverses with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive high-dimensional asymptotic properties of the Moore-Penrose inverse and the ridge-type inverse of the sample covariance matrix. In particular, the analytical expressions of the weighted sample trace moments are deduced for both generalized inverse matrices and are present by using the partial exponential Bell polynomials which can easily be computed in practice. The existent results are extended in several directions: (i) First, the population covariance matrix is not assumed to be a multiple of the identity matrix; (ii) Second, the assumption of normality is not used in the derivation; (iii) Third, the asymptotic results are derived under the high-dimensional asymptotic regime. Our findings are used to construct improved shrinkage estimators of the precision matrix, which asymptotically minimize the quadratic loss with probability one. Finally, the finite sample properties of the derived theoretical results are investigated via an extensive simulation study.</description>

      <title>Augmented Doubly Robust Post-Imputation Inference for Proteomic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative measurements produced by mass spectrometry proteomics experiments offer a direct way to explore the role of proteins in molecular mechanisms. However, analysis of such data is challenging due to the large proportion of missing values. A common strategy to address this issue is to utilize an imputed dataset, which often introduces systematic bias into downstream analyses if the imputation errors are ignored. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework inspired by doubly robust estimators that offers valid and efficient inference for proteomic data. Our framework combines powerful machine learning tools, such as variational autoencoders, to augment the imputation quality with high-dimensional peptide data, and a parametric model to estimate the propensity score for debiasing imputed outcomes. Our estimator is compatible with the double machine learning framework and has provable properties. In application to both single-cell and bulk-cell proteomic data our method utilizes the imputed data to gain additional, meaningful discoveries and yet maintains good control of false positives.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative method for constructing copula models capable of describing arbitrary non-monotone dependence structures. The proposed method enables the creation of such copulas in parametric form, thus allowing the resulting models to adapt to diverse and intricate real-world data patterns. We apply this novel methodology to analyze the relationship between returns and trading volumes in financial markets, a domain where the existence of non-monotone dependencies is well-documented in the existing literature. Our approach exhibits superior adaptability compared to other models which have previously been proposed in the literature, enabling a deeper understanding of the dependence structure among the considered variables.</description>

      <title>Integrated path stability selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability selection is a widely used method for improving the performance of feature selection algorithms. However, stability selection has been found to be highly conservative, resulting in low sensitivity. Further, the theoretical bound on the expected number of false positives, E(FP), is relatively loose, making it difficult to know how many false positives to expect in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for stability selection based on integrating the stability paths rather than maximizing over them. This yields a tighter bound on E(FP), resulting in a feature selection criterion that has higher sensitivity in practice and is better calibrated in terms of matching the target E(FP). Our proposed method requires the same amount of computation as the original stability selection algorithm, and only requires the user to specify one input parameter, a target value for E(FP). We provide theoretical bounds on performance, and demonstrate the method on simulations and real data from cancer gene expression studies.</description>

      <title>Bayesian segmented Gaussian copula factor model for single-cell sequencing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell sequencing technologies have significantly advanced molecular and cellular biology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity by allowing for the measurement of gene expression at an individual cell level. However, the analysis of such data is challenged by the prevalence of low counts due to dropout events and the skewed nature of the data distribution, which conventional Gaussian factor models struggle to handle effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Bayesian segmented Gaussian copula model to explicitly account for inflation of zero and near-zero counts, and to address the high skewness in the data. By employing a Dirichlet-Laplace prior for each column of the factor loadings matrix, we shrink the loadings of unnecessary factors towards zero, which leads to a simple approach to automatically determine the number of latent factors, and resolve the identifiability issue inherent in factor models due to the rotational invariance of the factor loadings matrix. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing approaches in conducting factor analysis on data exhibiting the characteristics of single-cell data, such as excessive low counts and high skewness. Furthermore, we apply the proposed method to a real single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset from a lymphoblastoid cell line, successfully identifying biologically meaningful latent factors and detecting previously uncharacterized cell subtypes.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal differentially private low-rank trace regression with guaranteed private initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study differentially private (DP) estimation of a rank-$r$ matrix $M \in \RR^{d_1\times d_2}$ under the trace regression model with Gaussian measurement matrices. Theoretically, the sensitivity of non-private spectral initialization is precisely characterized, and the differential-privacy-constrained minimax lower bound for estimating $M$ under the Schatten-$q$ norm is established. Methodologically, the paper introduces a computationally efficient algorithm for DP-initialization with a sample size of $n \geq \wt O (r^2 (d_1\vee d_2))$. Under certain regularity conditions, the DP-initialization falls within a local ball surrounding $M$. We also propose a differentially private algorithm for estimating $M$ based on Riemannian optimization (DP-RGrad), which achieves a near-optimal convergence rate with the DP-initialization and sample size of $n \geq \wt O(r (d_1 + d_2))$. Finally, the paper discusses the non-trivial gap between the minimax lower bound and the upper bound of low-rank matrix estimation under the trace regression model. It is shown that the estimator given by DP-RGrad attains the optimal convergence rate in a weaker notion of differential privacy. Our powerful technique for analyzing the sensitivity of initialization requires no eigengap condition between $r$ non-zero singular values.</description>

      <title>Learning Directed Acyclic Graphs from Partial Orderings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are commonly used to model causal relationships among random variables. In general, learning the DAG structure is both computationally and statistically challenging. Moreover, without additional information, the direction of edges may not be estimable from observational data. In contrast, given a complete causal ordering of the variables, the problem can be solved efficiently, even in high dimensions. In this paper, we consider the intermediate problem of learning DAGs when a partial causal ordering of variables is available. We propose a general estimation framework for leveraging the partial ordering and present efficient estimation algorithms for low- and high-dimensional problems. The advantages of the proposed framework are illustrated via numerical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Descriptive statistics for parametric models are currently highly sensative to departures, gross errors, and/or random errors. Here, leveraging the structures of parametric distributions and their central moment kernel distributions, a class of estimators, consistent simultanously for both a semiparametric distribution and a distinct parametric distribution, is proposed. These efficient estimators are robust to both gross errors and departures from parametric assumptions, making them ideal for estimating the mean and central moments of common unimodal distributions. This article opens up the possibility of utilizing the common nature of probability models to construct near-optimal estimators that are suitable for various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Manifold Regularization Classification Model Based On Improved Diffusion Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manifold regularization model is a semi-supervised learning model that leverages the geometric structure of a dataset, comprising a small number of labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples, to generate classifiers. However, the original manifold norm limits the performance of models to local regions. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an approach to improve manifold regularization based on a label propagation model. We initially enhance the probability transition matrix of the diffusion map algorithm, which can be used to estimate the Neumann heat kernel, enabling it to accurately depict the label propagation process on the manifold. Using this matrix, we establish a label propagation function on the dataset to describe the distribution of labels at different time steps. Subsequently, we extend the label propagation function to the entire data manifold. We prove that the extended label propagation function converges to a stable distribution after a sufficiently long time and can be considered as a classifier. Building upon this concept, we propose a viable improvement to the manifold regularization model and validate its superiority through experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is of special importance in the clinical trial to compare survival times between the treatment group and the control group. Propensity score methods with a logistic regression model are often used to reduce the effects of confounders. However, the modeling of complex structures between the covariates, the treatment assignment and the survival time is difficult. In this paper, we consider coarsened exact matching (CEM), which does not need any parametric models, and we propose the weighted log-rank statistic based on CEM. We derive asymptotic properties of the weighted log-rank statistic, such as the weak convergence to a Gaussian process in Skorokhod space, in particular the asymptotic normality, under the null hypothesis and the consistency of the log-rank test. Simulation studies show that the log-rank statistic based on CEM is more robust than the log-rank statistic based on the propensity score.</description>

      <title>Covariate-adjusted marginal cumulative incidence curves for competing risk analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariate imbalance between treatment groups makes it difficult to compare cumulative incidence curves in competing risk analyses. In this paper we discuss different methods to estimate adjusted cumulative incidence curves including inverse probability of treatment weighting and outcome regression modeling. For these methods to work, correct specification of the propensity score model or outcome regression model, respectively, is needed. We introduce a new doubly robust estimator, which requires correct specification of only one of the two models. We conduct a simulation study to assess the performance of these three methods, including scenarios with model misspecification of the relationship between covariates and treatment and/or outcome. We illustrate their usage in a cohort study of breast cancer patients estimating covariate-adjusted marginal cumulative incidence curves for recurrence, second primary tumour development and death after undergoing mastectomy treatment or breast-conserving therapy. Our study points out the advantages and disadvantages of each covariate adjustment method when applied in competing risk analysis.</description>

Abstract: Causal inference is crucial for understanding the true impact of interventions, policies, or actions, enabling informed decision-making and providing insights into the underlying mechanisms that shape our world. In this paper, we establish a framework for the estimation and inference of average treatment effects using a two-sample empirical likelihood function. Two different approaches to incorporating propensity scores are developed. The first approach introduces propensity scores calibrated constraints in addition to the standard model-calibration constraints; the second approach uses the propensity scores to form weighted versions of the model-calibration constraints. The resulting estimators from both approaches are doubly robust. The limiting distributions of the two sample empirical likelihood ratio statistics are derived, facilitating the construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for the average treatment effect. Bootstrap methods for constructing sample empirical likelihood ratio confidence intervals are also discussed for both approaches. Finite sample performances of the methods are investigated through simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Round Robin Active Sequential Change Detection for Dependent Multi-Channel Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of sequentially detecting a change in the joint distribution of multiple data sources under a sampling constraint. Specifically, the channels or sources generate observations that are independent over time, but not necessarily independent at any given time instant. The sources follow an initial joint distribution, and at an unknown time instant, the joint distribution of an unknown subset of sources changes. Importantly, there is a hard constraint that only a fixed number of sources are allowed to be sampled at each time instant. The goal is to sequentially observe the sources according to the constraint, and stop sampling as quickly as possible after the change while controlling the false alarm rate below a user-specified level. The sources can be selected dynamically based on the already collected data, and thus, a policy for this problem consists of a joint sampling and change-detection rule. A non-randomized policy is studied, and an upper bound is established on its worst-case conditional expected detection delay with respect to both the change point and the observations from the affected sources before the change.</description>

      <title>Uniform-over-dimension convergence with application to location tests for high-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic methods for hypothesis testing in high-dimensional data usually require the dimension of the observations to increase to infinity, often with an additional condition on its rate of increase compared to the sample size. On the other hand, multivariate asymptotic methods are valid for fixed dimension only, and their practical implementations in hypothesis testing methodology typically require the sample size to be large compared to the dimension for yielding desirable results. However, in practical scenarios, it is usually not possible to determine whether the dimension of the data at hand conform to the conditions required for the validity of the high-dimensional asymptotic methods, or whether the sample size is large enough compared to the dimension of the data. In this work, a theory of asymptotic convergence is proposed, which holds uniformly over the dimension of the random vectors. This theory attempts to unify the asymptotic results for fixed-dimensional multivariate data and high-dimensional data, and accounts for the effect of the dimension of the data on the performance of the hypothesis testing procedures. The methodology developed based on this asymptotic theory can be applied to data of any dimension. An application of this theory is demonstrated in the two-sample test for the equality of locations. The test statistic proposed is unscaled by the sample covariance, similar to usual tests for high-dimensional data. Using simulated examples, it is demonstrated that the proposed test exhibits better performance compared to several popular tests in the literature for high-dimensional data. Further, it is demonstrated in simulated models that the proposed unscaled test performs better than the usual scaled two-sample tests for multivariate data, including the Hotelling's $T^2$ test for multivariate Gaussian data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of constructing valid confidence intervals and sets in problems of prediction across multiple environments. We investigate two types of coverage suitable for these problems, extending the jackknife and split-conformal methods to show how to obtain distribution-free coverage in such non-traditional, hierarchical data-generating scenarios. Our contributions also include extensions for settings with non-real-valued responses and a theory of consistency for predictive inference in these general problems. We demonstrate a novel resizing method to adapt to problem difficulty, which applies both to existing approaches for predictive inference with hierarchical data and the methods we develop; this reduces prediction set sizes using limited information from the test environment, a key to the methods' practical performance, which we evaluate through neurochemical sensing and species classification datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies optimal hypothesis testing for nonregular statistical models with parameter-dependent support. We consider both one-sided and two-sided hypothesis testing and develop asymptotically uniformly most powerful tests based on the likelihood ratio process. The proposed one-sided test involves randomization to achieve asymptotic size control, some tuning constant to avoid discontinuities in the limiting likelihood ratio process, and a user-specified alternative hypothetical value to achieve the asymptotic optimality. Our two-sided test becomes asymptotically uniformly most powerful without imposing further restrictions such as unbiasedness. Simulation results illustrate desirable power properties of the proposed tests.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery from Poisson Branching Structural Causal Model Using High-Order Cumulant with Path Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Count data naturally arise in many fields, such as finance, neuroscience, and epidemiology, and discovering causal structure among count data is a crucial task in various scientific and industrial scenarios. One of the most common characteristics of count data is the inherent branching structure described by a binomial thinning operator and an independent Poisson distribution that captures both branching and noise. For instance, in a population count scenario, mortality and immigration contribute to the count, where survival follows a Bernoulli distribution, and immigration follows a Poisson distribution. However, causal discovery from such data is challenging due to the non-identifiability issue: a single causal pair is Markov equivalent, i.e., $X\rightarrow Y$ and $Y\rightarrow X$ are distributed equivalent. Fortunately, in this work, we found that the causal order from $X$ to its child $Y$ is identifiable if $X$ is a root vertex and has at least two directed paths to $Y$, or the ancestor of $X$ with the most directed path to $X$ has a directed path to $Y$ without passing $X$. Specifically, we propose a Poisson Branching Structure Causal Model (PB-SCM) and perform a path analysis on PB-SCM using high-order cumulants. Theoretical results establish the connection between the path and cumulant and demonstrate that the path information can be obtained from the cumulant. With the path information, causal order is identifiable under some graphical conditions. A practical algorithm for learning causal structure under PB-SCM is proposed and the experiments demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>The Role of Mean Absolute Deviation Function in Obtaining Smooth Estimation for Distribution and Density Functions: Beta Regression Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth Estimation of probability density and distribution functions from its sample is an attractive and an important problem that has applications in several fields such as, business, medicine, and environment. This article introduces a simple approach but novel for estimating both functions in one process to have smooth curves for both via left mean absolute deviation (MAD) function and beta regression approach. Our approach explores estimation of both functions by smoothing the first derivative of left MAD function to obtain the final optimal smooth estimates. The derivation for these final smooth estimates under conditions of nondecreasing distribution function and nonnegative density function are performed by applying beta regression of a polynomial degree on the first derivative of left MAD function where the degree of polynomial is chosen among the models that have less mean absolute residuals under the constraint of nonnegativity for the first derivative of regression vector of expected values. A general class of normal, logistic and Gumbel distributions is derived as proposed smooth estimators for the distribution and density functions using logit, probit and cloglog links, respectively. This approach is applied to simulated data from unimodal, bimodal, tri-modal and skew distributions and an application to real data set is given.</description>

      <title>Extremal properties of max-autoregressive moving average processes for modelling extreme river flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Max-autogressive moving average (Max-ARMA) processes are powerful tools for modelling time series data with heavy-tailed behaviour; these are a non-linear version of the popular autoregressive moving average models. River flow data typically have features of heavy tails and non-linearity, as large precipitation events cause sudden spikes in the data that then exponentially decay. Therefore, stationary Max-ARMA models are a suitable candidate for capturing the unique temporal dependence structure exhibited by river flows. This paper contributes to advancing our understanding of the extremal properties of stationary Max-ARMA processes. We detail the first approach for deriving the extremal index, the lagged asymptotic dependence coefficient, and an efficient simulation for a general Max-ARMA process. We use the extremal properties, coupled with the belief that Max-ARMA processes provide only an approximation to extreme river flow, to fit such a model which can broadly capture river flow behaviour over a high threshold. We make our inference under a reparametrisation which gives a simpler parameter space that excludes cases where any parameter is non-identifiable. We illustrate results for river flow data from the UK River Thames.</description>

Abstract: We compare three graphical methods for displaying evidence in a legal case: Wigmore Charts, Bayesian Networks and Chain Event Graphs. We find that these methods are aimed at three distinct audiences, respectively lawyers, forensic scientists and the police. The methods are illustrated using part of the evidence in the case of the murder of Meredith Kercher. More specifically, we focus on representing the list of propositions, evidence, testimony and facts given in the first trial against Raffaele Sollecito and Amanda Knox with these graphical methodologies.</description>

      <title>Quasi-randomization tests for network interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many classical inferential approaches fail to hold when interference exists among the population units. This amounts to the treatment status of one unit affecting the potential outcome of other units in the population. Testing for such spillover effects in this setting makes the null hypothesis non-sharp. An interesting approach to tackling the non-sharp nature of the null hypothesis in this setup is constructing conditional randomization tests such that the null is sharp on the restricted population. In randomized experiments, conditional randomized tests hold finite sample validity. Such approaches can pose computational challenges as finding these appropriate sub-populations based on experimental design can involve solving an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we view the network amongst the population as a random variable instead of being fixed. We propose a new approach that builds a conditional quasi-randomization test. Our main idea is to build the (non-sharp) null distribution of no spillover effects using random graph null models. We show that our method is exactly valid in finite-samples under mild assumptions. Our method displays enhanced power over other methods, with substantial improvement in complex experimental designs. We highlight that the method reduces to a simple permutation test, making it easy to implement in practice. We conduct a simulation study to verify the finite-sample validity of our approach and illustrate our methodology to test for interference in a weather insurance adoption experiment run in rural China.</description>

      <title>A note on generalization bounds for losses with finite moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the truncation method from Alquier [1] to derive high-probability PAC-Bayes bounds for unbounded losses with heavy tails. Assuming that the $p$-th moment is bounded, the resulting bounds interpolate between a slow rate $1 / \sqrt{n}$ when $p=2$, and a fast rate $1 / n$ when $p \to \infty$ and the loss is essentially bounded. Moreover, the paper derives a high-probability PAC-Bayes bound for losses with a bounded variance. This bound has an exponentially better dependence on the confidence parameter and the dependency measure than previous bounds in the literature. Finally, the paper extends all results to guarantees in expectation and single-draw PAC-Bayes. In order to so, it obtains analogues of the PAC-Bayes fast rate bound for bounded losses from [2] in these settings.</description>

      <title>Optimal convex $M$-estimation via score matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of linear regression, we construct a data-driven convex loss function with respect to which empirical risk minimisation yields optimal asymptotic variance in the downstream estimation of the regression coefficients. Our semiparametric approach targets the best decreasing approximation of the derivative of the log-density of the noise distribution. At the population level, this fitting process is a nonparametric extension of score matching, corresponding to a log-concave projection of the noise distribution with respect to the Fisher divergence. The procedure is computationally efficient, and we prove that our procedure attains the minimal asymptotic covariance among all convex $M$-estimators. As an example of a non-log-concave setting, for Cauchy errors, the optimal convex loss function is Huber-like, and our procedure yields an asymptotic efficiency greater than 0.87 relative to the oracle maximum likelihood estimator of the regression coefficients that uses knowledge of this error distribution; in this sense, we obtain robustness without sacrificing much efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the practical merits of our proposal.</description>

      <title>An alternative measure for quantifying the heterogeneity in meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the heterogeneity is an important issue in meta-analysis, and among the existing measures, the $I^2$ statistic is most commonly used. In this paper, we first illustrate with a simple example that the $I^2$ statistic is heavily dependent on the study sample sizes, mainly because it is used to quantify the heterogeneity between the observed effect sizes. To reduce the influence of sample sizes, we introduce an alternative measure that aims to directly measure the heterogeneity between the study populations involved in the meta-analysis. We further propose a new estimator, namely the $I_A^2$ statistic, to estimate the newly defined measure of heterogeneity. For practical implementation, the exact formulas of the $I_A^2$ statistic are also derived under two common scenarios with the effect size as the mean difference (MD) or the standardized mean difference (SMD). Simulations and real data analysis demonstrate that the $I_A^2$ statistic provides an asymptotically unbiased estimator for the absolute heterogeneity between the study populations, and it is also independent of the study sample sizes as expected. To conclude, our newly defined $I_A^2$ statistic can be used as a supplemental measure of heterogeneity to monitor the situations where the study effect sizes are indeed similar with little biological difference. In such scenario, the fixed-effect model can be appropriate; nevertheless, when the sample sizes are sufficiently large, the $I^2$ statistic may still increase to 1 and subsequently suggest the random-effects model for meta-analysis.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Protected Spatial Autoregressive Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial autoregressive (SAR) models are important tools for studying network effects. However, with an increasing emphasis on data privacy, data providers often implement privacy protection measures that make classical SAR models inapplicable. In this study, we introduce a privacy-protected SAR model with noise-added response and covariates to meet privacy-protection requirements. However, in this scenario, the traditional quasi-maximum likelihood estimator becomes infeasible because the likelihood function cannot be formulated. To address this issue, we first consider an explicit expression for the likelihood function with only noise-added responses. However, the derivatives are biased owing to the noise in the covariates. Therefore, we develop techniques that can correct the biases introduced by noise. Correspondingly, a Newton-Raphson-type algorithm is proposed to obtain the estimator, leading to a corrected likelihood estimator. To further enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a corrected least squares estimator based on the idea of bias correction. These two estimation methods ensure both data security and the attainment of statistically valid estimators. Theoretical analysis of both estimators is carefully conducted, and statistical inference methods are discussed. The finite sample performances of different methods are demonstrated through extensive simulations and the analysis of a real dataset.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Logrank-type Test for Comparison of Treatment Regimes in Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is the
  ideal study design for the evaluation of multistage treatment
  regimes, which comprise sequential decision rules that recommend
  treatments for a patient at each of a series of decision points
  based on their evolving characteristics. A common goal is to
  compare the set of so-called embedded regimes represented in the
  design on the basis of a primary outcome of interest. In the study
  of chronic diseases and disorders, this outcome is often a time to
  an event, and a goal is to compare the distributions of the
  time-to-event outcome associated with each regime in the set. We
  present a general statistical framework in which we develop a
  logrank-type test for comparison of the survival distributions
  associated with regimes within a specified set based on the data
  from a SMART with an arbitrary number of stages that allows
  incorporation of covariate information to enhance efficiency and can
  also be used with data from an observational study. The framework
  provides clarification of the assumptions required to yield a
  principled test procedure, and the proposed test subsumes or offers
  an improved alternative to existing methods. We demonstrate
  performance of the methods in a suite of simulation
  studies. The methods are applied to a SMART in patients with acute
  promyelocytic leukemia.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of predictive distributions driven by sample means and variances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha_n(\cdot)=P\bigl(X_{n+1}\in\cdot\mid X_1,\ldots,X_n\bigr)$ be the predictive distributions of a sequence $(X_1,X_2,\ldots)$ of $p$-variate random variables. Suppose $$\alpha_n=\mathcal{N}_p(M_n,Q_n)$$ where $M_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$ and $Q_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-M_n)(X_i-M_n)^t$. Then, there is a random probability measure $\alpha$ on $\mathbb{R}^p$ such that $\alpha_n\rightarrow\alpha$ weakly a.s. If $p\in\{1,2\}$, one also obtains $\lVert\alpha_n-\alpha\rVert\overset{a.s.}\longrightarrow 0$ where $\lVert\cdot\rVert$ is total variation distance. Moreover, the convergence rate of $\lVert\alpha_n-\alpha\rVert$ is arbitrarily close to $n^{-1/2}$. These results (apart from the one regarding the convergence rate) still apply even if $\alpha_n=\mathcal{L}_p(M_n,Q_n)$, where $\mathcal{L}_p$ belongs to a class of distributions much larger than the normal. Finally, the asymptotic behavior of copula-based predictive distributions (introduced in [13]) is investigated and a numerical experiment is performed.</description>

      <title>Testing for sufficient follow-up in survival data with a cure fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to estimate the proportion of `immune' or `cured' subjects who will never experience failure, a sufficiently long follow-up period is required. Several statistical tests have been proposed in the literature for assessing the assumption of sufficient follow-up, meaning that the study duration is longer than the support of the survival times for the uncured subjects. However, for practical purposes, the follow-up would be considered sufficiently long if the probability for the event to happen after the end of the study is very small. Based on this observation, we formulate a more relaxed notion of `practically' sufficient follow-up characterized by the quantiles of the distribution and develop a novel nonparametric statistical test. The proposed method relies mainly on the assumption of a non-increasing density function in the tail of the distribution. The test is then based on a shape constrained density estimator such as the Grenander or the kernel smoothed Grenander estimator and a bootstrap procedure is used for computation of the critical values. The performance of the test is investigated through an extensive simulation study, and the method is illustrated on breast cancer data.</description>

      <title>Comparing basic statistical concepts with diagnostic probabilities based on directly observed proportions to help understand the replication crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instead of regarding an observed proportion as a sample from a population with an unknown parameter, diagnosticians intuitively use the observed proportion as a direct estimate of the posterior probability of a diagnosis. Therefore, a diagnostician might also regard a continuous Gaussian probability distribution of an outcome conditional on a study selection criterion to represents posterior probabilities. Fitting a distribution to its mean and standard deviation (SD) can be regarded as pooling data from an infinite number of imaginary or theoretical studies with an identical mean and SD but randomly different numerical values. For a distribution of possible means based on a SEM, the posterior probability Q of any theoretically true mean falling into a specified tail would be equal to the tail area as a proportion of the whole. If the reverse likelihood distribution of possible study means conditional on the same hypothetical tail threshold is assumed to be the same as the posterior probability distribution of means (as is customary) then by Bayes rule the P value equals Q. Replication involves doing two independent studies, thus doubling the variance for the combined posterior probability distribution. Thus, if the original effect size was 1.96, the number of observations was 100, the SEM was 1 and the original P value was 0.025, the theoretical probability of a replicating study getting a P value of up to 0.025 again is only 0.283. By applying the double variance to power calculations, the required number of observations is doubled compared to conventional approaches. If these theoretical probabilities of replication are consistent with empirical replication study results, this might explain the replication crisis and make the concepts of statistics easier to understand by diagnosticians and others.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Simple Binary Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sample complexity of simple binary hypothesis testing is the smallest number of i.i.d. samples required to distinguish between two distributions $p$ and $q$ in either: (i) the prior-free setting, with type-I error at most $\alpha$ and type-II error at most $\beta$; or (ii) the Bayesian setting, with Bayes error at most $\delta$ and prior distribution $(\alpha, 1-\alpha)$. This problem has only been studied when $\alpha = \beta$ (prior-free) or $\alpha = 1/2$ (Bayesian), and the sample complexity is known to be characterized by the Hellinger divergence between $p$ and $q$, up to multiplicative constants. In this paper, we derive a formula that characterizes the sample complexity (up to multiplicative constants that are independent of $p$, $q$, and all error parameters) for: (i) all $0 \le \alpha, \beta \le 1/8$ in the prior-free setting; and (ii) all $\delta \le \alpha/4$ in the Bayesian setting. In particular, the formula admits equivalent expressions in terms of certain divergences from the Jensen--Shannon and Hellinger families. The main technical result concerns an $f$-divergence inequality between members of the Jensen--Shannon and Hellinger families, which is proved by a combination of information-theoretic tools and case-by-case analyses. We explore applications of our results to robust and distributed (locally-private and communication-constrained) hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Approximation and Estimation Ability of Transformers for Sequence-to-Sequence Functions with Infinite Dimensional Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the great success of Transformer networks in various applications such as natural language processing and computer vision, their theoretical aspects are not well understood. In this paper, we study the approximation and estimation ability of Transformers as sequence-to-sequence functions with infinite dimensional inputs. Although inputs and outputs are both infinite dimensional, we show that when the target function has anisotropic smoothness, Transformers can avoid the curse of dimensionality due to their feature extraction ability and parameter sharing property. In addition, we show that even if the smoothness changes depending on each input, Transformers can estimate the importance of features for each input and extract important features dynamically. Then, we proved that Transformers achieve similar convergence rate as in the case of the fixed smoothness. Our theoretical results support the practical success of Transformers for high dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Mean-field Analysis on Two-layer Neural Networks from a Kernel Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the feature learning ability of two-layer neural networks in the mean-field regime through the lens of kernel methods. To focus on the dynamics of the kernel induced by the first layer, we utilize a two-timescale limit, where the second layer moves much faster than the first layer. In this limit, the learning problem is reduced to the minimization problem over the intrinsic kernel. Then, we show the global convergence of the mean-field Langevin dynamics and derive time and particle discretization error. We also demonstrate that two-layer neural networks can learn a union of multiple reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces more efficiently than any kernel methods, and neural networks acquire data-dependent kernel which aligns with the target function. In addition, we develop a label noise procedure, which converges to the global optimum and show that the degrees of freedom appears as an implicit regularization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Weighting Schemes for Auditing Instant-Runoff Voting Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various risk-limiting audit (RLA) methods have been developed for instant-runoff voting (IRV) elections. A recent method, AWAIRE, is the first efficient approach that does not require cast vote records (CVRs). AWAIRE involves adaptively weighted averages of test statistics, essentially "learning" an effective set of hypotheses to test. However, the initial paper on AWAIRE only examined a few weighting schemes and parameter settings.
  We provide an extensive exploration of schemes and settings, to identify and recommend efficient choices for practical use. We focus only on the (hardest) case where CVRs are not available, using simulations based on real election data to assess performance.
  Across our comparisons, the most effective schemes are often those that place most or all of the weight on the apparent "best" hypotheses based on already seen data. Conversely, the optimal tuning parameters tended to vary based on the election margin. Nonetheless, we quantify the performance trade-offs for different choices across varying election margins, aiding in selecting the most desirable trade-off if a default option is needed.
  A limitation of the current AWAIRE implementation is its restriction to handling a small number of candidates (previously demonstrated up to six candidates). One path to a more computationally efficient implementation would be to use lazy evaluation and avoid considering all possible hypotheses. Our findings suggest that such an approach could be done without substantially comprising statistical performance.</description>

      <title>Agile gesture recognition for low-power applications: customisation for generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated hand gesture recognition has long been a focal point in the AI community. Traditionally, research in this field has predominantly focused on scenarios with access to a continuous flow of hand's images. This focus has been driven by the widespread use of cameras and the abundant availability of image data. However, there is an increasing demand for gesture recognition technologies that operate on low-power sensor devices. This is due to the rising concerns for data leakage and end-user privacy, as well as the limited battery capacity and the computing power in low-cost devices. Moreover, the challenge in data collection for individually designed hardware also hinders the generalisation of a gesture recognition model.
  In this study, we unveil a novel methodology for pattern recognition systems using adaptive and agile error correction, designed to enhance the performance of legacy gesture recognition models on devices with limited battery capacity and computing power. This system comprises a compact Support Vector Machine as the base model for live gesture recognition. Additionally, it features an adaptive agile error corrector that employs few-shot learning within the feature space induced by high-dimensional kernel mappings. The error corrector can be customised for each user, allowing for dynamic adjustments to the gesture prediction based on their movement patterns while maintaining the agile performance of its base model on a low-cost and low-power micro-controller. This proposed system is distinguished by its compact size, rapid processing speed, and low power consumption, making it ideal for a wide range of embedded systems.</description>

      <title>Emotion Detection with Transformers: A Comparative Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of transformer-based models for emotion classification on text data. We train and evaluate several pre-trained transformer models, on the Emotion dataset using different variants of transformers. The paper also analyzes some factors that in-fluence the performance of the model, such as the fine-tuning of the transformer layer, the trainability of the layer, and the preprocessing of the text data. Our analysis reveals that commonly applied techniques like removing punctuation and stop words can hinder model performance. This might be because transformers strength lies in understanding contextual relationships within text. Elements like punctuation and stop words can still convey sentiment or emphasis and removing them might disrupt this context.</description>

      <title>A Causal Analysis of CO2 Reduction Strategies in Electricity Markets Through Machine Learning-Driven Metalearners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs the Causal Machine Learning (CausalML) statistical method to analyze the influence of electricity pricing policies on carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the household sector. Investigating the causality between potential outcomes and treatment effects, where changes in pricing policies are the treatment, our analysis challenges the conventional wisdom surrounding incentive-based electricity pricing. The study's findings suggest that adopting such policies may inadvertently increase CO2 intensity. Additionally, we integrate a machine learning-based meta-algorithm, reflecting a contemporary statistical approach, to enhance the depth of our causal analysis. The study conducts a comparative analysis of learners X, T, S, and R to ascertain the optimal methods based on the defined question's specified goals and contextual nuances. This research contributes valuable insights to the ongoing dialogue on sustainable development practices, emphasizing the importance of considering unintended consequences in policy formulation.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric inference of higher order interaction patterns in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for obtaining parsimonious decompositions of networks into higher order interactions which can take the form of arbitrary motifs.The method is based on a class of analytically solvable generative models, where vertices are connected via explicit copies of motifs, which in combination with non-parametric priors allow us to infer higher order interactions from dyadic graph data without any prior knowledge on the types or frequencies of such interactions. Crucially, we also consider 'degree--corrected' models that correctly reflect the degree distribution of the network and consequently prove to be a better fit for many real world--networks compared to non-degree corrected models. We test the presented approach on simulated data for which we recover the set of underlying higher order interactions to a high degree of accuracy. For empirical networks the method identifies concise sets of atomic subgraphs from within thousands of candidates that cover a large fraction of edges and include higher order interactions of known structural and functional significance. The method not only produces an explicit higher order representation of the network but also a fit of the network to analytically tractable models opening new avenues for the systematic study of higher order network structures.</description>

      <title>Role of Locality and Weight Sharing in Image-Based Tasks: A Sample Complexity Separation between CNNs, LCNs, and FCNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision tasks are characterized by the properties of locality and translation invariance. The superior performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on these tasks is widely attributed to the inductive bias of locality and weight sharing baked into their architecture. Existing attempts to quantify the statistical benefits of these biases in CNNs over locally connected convolutional neural networks (LCNs) and fully connected neural networks (FCNs) fall into one of the following categories: either they disregard the optimizer and only provide uniform convergence upper bounds with no separating lower bounds, or they consider simplistic tasks that do not truly mirror the locality and translation invariance as found in real-world vision tasks. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Dynamic Signal Distribution (DSD) classification task that models an image as consisting of $k$ patches, each of dimension $d$, and the label is determined by a $d$-sparse signal vector that can freely appear in any one of the $k$ patches. On this task, for any orthogonally equivariant algorithm like gradient descent, we prove that CNNs require $\tilde{O}(k+d)$ samples, whereas LCNs require $\Omega(kd)$ samples, establishing the statistical advantages of weight sharing in translation invariant tasks. Furthermore, LCNs need $\tilde{O}(k(k+d))$ samples, compared to $\Omega(k^2d)$ samples for FCNs, showcasing the benefits of locality in local tasks. Additionally, we develop information theoretic tools for analyzing randomized algorithms, which may be of interest for statistical research.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Latent Neural Causal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal representation learning seeks to uncover latent, high-level causal representations from low-level observed data. It is particularly good at predictions under unseen distribution shifts, because these shifts can generally be interpreted as consequences of interventions. Hence leveraging {seen} distribution shifts becomes a natural strategy to help identifying causal representations, which in turn benefits predictions where distributions are previously {unseen}. Determining the types (or conditions) of such distribution shifts that do contribute to the identifiability of causal representations is critical. This work establishes a {sufficient} and {necessary} condition characterizing the types of distribution shifts for identifiability in the context of latent additive noise models. Furthermore, we present partial identifiability results when only a portion of distribution shifts meets the condition. In addition, we extend our findings to latent post-nonlinear causal models. We translate our findings into a practical algorithm, allowing for the acquisition of reliable latent causal representations. Our algorithm, guided by our underlying theory, has demonstrated outstanding performance across a diverse range of synthetic and real-world datasets. The empirical observations align closely with the theoretical findings, affirming the robustness and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Boarding for ISS: Imbalanced Self-Supervised: Discovery of a Scaled Autoencoder for Mixed Tabular Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of imbalanced self-supervised learning, especially in the context of tabular data, has not been extensively studied. Existing research has predominantly focused on image datasets. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining the specific challenges posed by data imbalance in self-supervised learning in the domain of tabular data, with a primary focus on autoencoders. Autoencoders are widely employed for learning and constructing a new representation of a dataset, particularly for dimensionality reduction. They are also often used for generative model learning, as seen in variational autoencoders. When dealing with mixed tabular data, qualitative variables are often encoded using a one-hot encoder with a standard loss function (MSE or Cross Entropy). In this paper, we analyze the drawbacks of this approach, especially when categorical variables are imbalanced. We propose a novel metric to balance learning: a Multi-Supervised Balanced MSE. This approach reduces the reconstruction error by balancing the influence of variables. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that this new metric, compared to the standard MSE: i) outperforms when the dataset is imbalanced, especially when the learning process is insufficient, and ii) provides similar results in the opposite case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of research in computational psycholinguistics has concentrated on the processing of words. This study introduces innovative methods for computing sentence-level metrics using multilingual large language models. The metrics developed sentence surprisal and sentence relevance and then are tested and compared to validate whether they can predict how humans comprehend sentences as a whole across languages. These metrics offer significant interpretability and achieve high accuracy in predicting human sentence reading speeds. Our results indicate that these computational sentence-level metrics are exceptionally effective at predicting and elucidating the processing difficulties encountered by readers in comprehending sentences as a whole across a variety of languages. Their impressive performance and generalization capabilities provide a promising avenue for future research in integrating LLMs and cognitive science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work shows that path gradient estimators for normalizing flows have lower variance compared to standard estimators for variational inference, resulting in improved training. However, they are often prohibitively more expensive from a computational point of view and cannot be applied to maximum likelihood training in a scalable manner, which severely hinders their widespread adoption. In this work, we overcome these crucial limitations. Specifically, we propose a fast path gradient estimator which improves computational efficiency significantly and works for all normalizing flow architectures of practical relevance. We then show that this estimator can also be applied to maximum likelihood training for which it has a regularizing effect as it can take the form of a given target energy function into account. We empirically establish its superior performance and reduced variance for several natural sciences applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Gaussian Covariance Network with Trajectory Sampling for Data-Efficient Policy Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic world models increase data efficiency of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) by guiding the policy with their epistemic uncertainty to improve exploration and acquire new samples. Moreover, the uncertainty-aware learning procedures in probabilistic approaches lead to robust policies that are less sensitive to noisy observations compared to uncertainty unaware solutions. We propose to combine trajectory sampling and deep Gaussian covariance network (DGCN) for a data-efficient solution to MBRL problems in an optimal control setting. We compare trajectory sampling with density-based approximation for uncertainty propagation using three different probabilistic world models; Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, and DGCNs. We provide empirical evidence using four different well-known test environments, that our method improves the sample-efficiency over other combinations of uncertainty propagation methods and probabilistic models. During our tests, we place particular emphasis on the robustness of the learned policies with respect to noisy initial states.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Solution to Covariance Propagation in Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of neural networks is critical to measuring the reliability and robustness of deep learning systems. However, this often involves costly or inaccurate sampling methods and approximations. This paper presents a sample-free moment propagation technique that propagates mean vectors and covariance matrices across a network to accurately characterize the input-output distributions of neural networks. A key enabler of our technique is an analytic solution for the covariance of random variables passed through nonlinear activation functions, such as Heaviside, ReLU, and GELU. The wide applicability and merits of the proposed technique are shown in experiments analyzing the input-output distributions of trained neural networks and training Bayesian neural networks.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection via Deep Multi-Comprehension Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research underscores the pivotal role of the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) feature representation field scale in determining the efficacy of models in OOD detection. Consequently, the adoption of model ensembles has emerged as a prominent strategy to augment this feature representation field, capitalizing on anticipated model diversity.
  However, our introduction of novel qualitative and quantitative model ensemble evaluation methods, specifically Loss Basin/Barrier Visualization and the Self-Coupling Index, reveals a critical drawback in existing ensemble methods. We find that these methods incorporate weights that are affine-transformable, exhibiting limited variability and thus failing to achieve the desired diversity in feature representation.
  To address this limitation, we elevate the dimensions of traditional model ensembles, incorporating various factors such as different weight initializations, data holdout, etc., into distinct supervision tasks. This innovative approach, termed Multi-Comprehension (MC) Ensemble, leverages diverse training tasks to generate distinct comprehensions of the data and labels, thereby extending the feature representation field.
  Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the MC Ensemble strategy in OOD detection compared to both the naive Deep Ensemble method and a standalone model of comparable size. This underscores the effectiveness of our proposed approach in enhancing the model's capability to detect instances outside its training distribution.</description>

      <title>Learning Action-based Representations Using Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning agents using high-dimensional observations must be able to identify relevant state features amidst many exogeneous distractors. A representation that captures controllability identifies these state elements by determining what affects agent control. While methods such as inverse dynamics and mutual information capture controllability for a limited number of timesteps, capturing long-horizon elements remains a challenging problem. Myopic controllability can capture the moment right before an agent crashes into a wall, but not the control-relevance of the wall while the agent is still some distance away. To address this we introduce action-bisimulation encoding, a method inspired by the bisimulation invariance pseudometric, that extends single-step controllability with a recursive invariance constraint. By doing this, action-bisimulation learns a multi-step controllability metric that smoothly discounts distant state features that are relevant for control. We demonstrate that action-bisimulation pretraining on reward-free, uniformly random data improves sample efficiency in several environments, including a photorealistic 3D simulation domain, Habitat. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis and qualitative results demonstrating the information captured by action-bisimulation.</description>

      <title>Real-time Adaptation for Condition Monitoring Signal Prediction using Label-aware Neural Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a predictive model that rapidly adapts to real-time condition monitoring (CM) signals is critical for engineering systems/units. Unfortunately, many current methods suffer from a trade-off between representation power and agility in online settings. For instance, parametric methods that assume an underlying functional form for CM signals facilitate efficient online prediction updates. However, this simplification leads to vulnerability to model specifications and an inability to capture complex signals. On the other hand, approaches based on over-parameterized or non-parametric models can excel at explaining complex nonlinear signals, but real-time updates for such models pose a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a neural process-based approach that addresses this trade-off. It encodes available observations within a CM signal into a representation space and then reconstructs the signal's history and evolution for prediction. Once trained, the model can encode an arbitrary number of observations without requiring retraining, enabling on-the-spot real-time predictions along with quantified uncertainty and can be readily updated as more online data is gathered. Furthermore, our model is designed to incorporate qualitative information (i.e., labels) from individual units. This integration not only enhances individualized predictions for each unit but also enables joint inference for both signals and their associated labels. Numerical studies on both synthetic and real-world data in reliability engineering highlight the advantageous features of our model in real-time adaptation, enhanced signal prediction with uncertainty quantification, and joint prediction for labels and signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator for accelerating the sampling stage of Monte Carlo simulations. We used the LiteX framework to generate a Petitbateau FemtoRV RISC-V instruction set soft processor and deploy it on a Digilent Arty-100T FPGA development board. The RISC-V soft processor augmented with our programmable random variate accelerator achieves an average speedup of 8.70 times and a median speedup of 8.68 times for a suite of twelve different benchmark applications when compared to GNU Scientific Library software random number generation. These speedups are achievable because the benchmarks spend an average of 90.0 % of their execution time generating random samples. The results of the Monte Carlo benchmark programs run over the programmable random variate accelerator have an average Wasserstein distance of 1.48 times and a median Wasserstein distance of 1.41 times$that of the results produced by the GNU Scientific Library random number generators. The soft processor samples the electron tunneling noise source using the hardened XADC block in the FPGA. The flexibility of the LiteX framework allows for the deployment of any LiteX-supported soft processor with an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator on any LiteX-supported development board that contains an FPGA with an XADC.</description>

      <title>On the rates of convergence for learning with convolutional neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the approximation and learning capacities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our first result proves a new approximation bound for CNNs with certain constraint on the weights. Our second result gives a new analysis on the covering number of feed-forward neural networks, which include CNNs as special cases. The analysis carefully takes into account the size of the weights and hence gives better bounds than existing literature in some situations. Using these two results, we are able to derive rates of convergence for estimators based on CNNs in many learning problems. In particular, we establish minimax optimal convergence rates of the least squares based on CNNs for learning smooth functions in the nonparametric regression setting. For binary classification, we derive convergence rates for CNN classifiers with hinge loss and logistic loss. It is also shown that the obtained rates are minimax optimal in several settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dvoretzky--Kiefer--Wolfowitz--Massart inequality gives a sub-Gaussian tail bound on the supremum norm distance between the empirical distribution function of a random sample and its population counterpart. We provide a short proof of a result that improves the existing bound in two respects. First, our one-sided bound holds without any restrictions on the failure probability, thereby verifying a conjecture of Birnbaum and McCarty (1958). Second, it is local in the sense that it holds uniformly over sub-intervals of the real line with an error rate that adapts to the behaviour of the population distribution function on the interval.</description>

Abstract: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a fundamental tool for signal analysis, widely used across various fields. However, traditional FFT methods encounter challenges in adjusting the frequency bin interval, which may impede accurate spectral analysis. In this study, we propose a method for adjusting the frequency bin interval in FFT by introducing a parameter $\alpha$. We elucidate the underlying principles of the proposed method and discuss its potential applications across various contexts. Our findings suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach to overcome the limitations of traditional FFT methods and enhance spectral analysis accuracy.</description>

      <title>Weak Convergence Analysis of Online Neural Actor-Critic Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a single-layer neural network trained with the online actor critic algorithm converges in distribution to a random ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number of hidden units and the number of training steps $\rightarrow \infty$. In the online actor-critic algorithm, the distribution of the data samples dynamically changes as the model is updated, which is a key challenge for any convergence analysis. We establish the geometric ergodicity of the data samples under a fixed actor policy. Then, using a Poisson equation, we prove that the fluctuations of the model updates around the limit distribution due to the randomly-arriving data samples vanish as the number of parameter updates $\rightarrow \infty$. Using the Poisson equation and weak convergence techniques, we prove that the actor neural network and critic neural network converge to the solutions of a system of ODEs with random initial conditions. Analysis of the limit ODE shows that the limit critic network will converge to the true value function, which will provide the actor an asymptotically unbiased estimate of the policy gradient. We then prove that the limit actor network will converge to a stationary point.</description>

      <title>Resistant Inference in Instrumental Variable Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical tests in the instrumental variable model can behave arbitrarily if the data is contaminated. For instance, one outlying observation can be enough to change the outcome of a test. We develop a framework to construct testing procedures that are robust to weak instruments, outliers and heavy-tailed errors in the instrumental variable model. The framework is constructed upon M-estimators. By deriving the influence functions of the classical weak instrument robust tests, such as the Anderson-Rubin test, K-test and the conditional likelihood ratio (CLR) test, we prove their unbounded sensitivity to infinitesimal contamination. Therefore, we construct contamination resistant/robust alternatives. In particular, we show how to construct a robust CLR statistic based on Mallows type M-estimators and show that its asymptotic distribution is the same as that of the (classical) CLR statistic. The theoretical results are corroborated by a simulation study. Finally, we revisit three empirical studies affected by outliers and demonstrate how the new robust tests can be used in practice.</description>

      <title>Conformal Off-Policy Prediction for Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-Policy Prediction (OPP), i.e., predicting the outcomes of a target policy using only data collected under a nominal (behavioural) policy, is a paramount problem in data-driven analysis of safety-critical systems where the deployment of a new policy may be unsafe. To achieve dependable off-policy predictions, recent work on Conformal Off-Policy Prediction (COPP) leverage the conformal prediction framework to derive prediction regions with probabilistic guarantees under the target process. Existing COPP methods can account for the distribution shifts induced by policy switching, but are limited to single-agent systems and scalar outcomes (e.g., rewards). In this work, we introduce MA-COPP, the first conformal prediction method to solve OPP problems involving multi-agent systems, deriving joint prediction regions for all agents' trajectories when one or more "ego" agents change their policies. Unlike the single-agent scenario, this setting introduces higher complexity as the distribution shifts affect predictions for all agents, not just the ego agents, and the prediction task involves full multi-dimensional trajectories, not just reward values. A key contribution of MA-COPP is to avoid enumeration or exhaustive search of the output space of agent trajectories, which is instead required by existing COPP methods to construct the prediction region. We achieve this by showing that an over-approximation of the true JPR can be constructed, without enumeration, from the maximum density ratio of the JPR trajectories. We evaluate the effectiveness of MA-COPP in multi-agent systems from the PettingZoo library and the F1TENTH autonomous racing environment, achieving nominal coverage in higher dimensions and various shift settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning graph generative models over latent spaces has received less attention compared to models that operate on the original data space and has so far demonstrated lacklustre performance. We present GLAD a latent space graph generative model. Unlike most previous latent space graph generative models, GLAD operates on a discrete latent space that preserves to a significant extent the discrete nature of the graph structures making no unnatural assumptions such as latent space continuity. We learn the prior of our discrete latent space by adapting diffusion bridges to its structure. By operating over an appropriately constructed latent space we avoid relying on decompositions that are often used in models that operate in the original data space. We present experiments on a series of graph benchmark datasets which clearly show the superiority of the discrete latent space and obtain state of the art graph generative performance, making GLAD the first latent space graph generative model with competitive performance.

      <title>SCOD: From Heuristics to Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of designing reliable prediction models that abstain from predictions when faced with uncertain or out-of-distribution samples - a recently proposed problem known as Selective Classification in the presence of Out-of-Distribution data (SCOD). We make three key contributions to SCOD. Firstly, we demonstrate that the optimal SCOD strategy involves a Bayes classifier for in-distribution (ID) data and a selector represented as a stochastic linear classifier in a 2D space, using i) the conditional risk of the ID classifier, and ii) the likelihood ratio of ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) data as input. This contrasts with suboptimal strategies from current OOD detection methods and the Softmax Information Retaining Combination (SIRC), specifically developed for SCOD. Secondly, we establish that in a distribution-free setting, the SCOD problem is not Probably Approximately Correct learnable when relying solely on an ID data sample. Third, we introduce POSCOD, a simple method for learning a plugin estimate of the optimal SCOD strategy from both an ID data sample and an unlabeled mixture of ID and OOD data. Our empirical results confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our proposed method, POSCOD, out performs existing OOD methods in effectively addressing the SCOD problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated success in controlling sentence attributes ($e.g.$, sentiment) and structure ($e.g.$, syntactic structure) based on the diffusion language model. A key component that drives theimpressive performance for generating high-quality samples from noise is iteratively denoise for thousands of steps. While beneficial, the complexity of starting from the noise and the learning steps has limited its implementation to many NLP real-world applications. This paper proposes Language Rectified Flow ({\ours}). Our method is based on the reformulation of the standard probabilistic flow models. Language rectified flow learns (neural) ordinary differential equation models to transport between the source distribution and the target distribution, hence providing a unified and effective solution to generative modeling and domain transfer. From the source distribution, our language rectified flow yields fast simulation and effectively decreases the inference time. Experiments on three challenging fine-grained control tasks and multiple high-quality text editing show that our method consistently outperforms its baselines. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method can be general, effective, and beneficial for many NLP tasks.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel use of a broadcasting operation, which distributes univariate functions to all entries of the tensor covariate, to model the nonlinearity in tensor regression nonparametrically. A penalized estimation and the corresponding algorithm are proposed. Our theoretical investigation, which allows the dimensions of the tensor covariate to diverge, indicates that the proposed estimation yields a desirable convergence rate. We also provide a minimax lower bound, which characterizes the optimality of the proposed estimator for a wide range of scenarios. Numerical experiments are conducted to confirm the theoretical findings, and they show that the proposed model has advantages over its existing linear counterparts.</description>

Abstract: Sequential learning problems are common in several fields of research and practical applications. Examples include dynamic pricing and assortment, design of auctions and incentives and permeate a large number of sequential treatment experiments. In this paper, we extend one of the most popular learning solutions, the $\epsilon_t$-greedy heuristics, to high-dimensional contexts considering a conservative directive. We do this by allocating part of the time the original rule uses to adopt completely new actions to a more focused search in a restrictive set of promising actions. The resulting rule might be useful for practical applications that still values surprises, although at a decreasing rate, while also has restrictions on the adoption of unusual actions. With high probability, we find reasonable bounds for the cumulative regret of a conservative high-dimensional decaying $\epsilon_t$-greedy rule. Also, we provide a lower bound for the cardinality of the set of viable actions that implies in an improved regret bound for the conservative version when compared to its non-conservative counterpart. Additionally, we show that end-users have sufficient flexibility when establishing how much safety they want, since it can be tuned without impacting theoretical properties. We illustrate our proposal both in a simulation exercise and using a real dataset.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic bias reduction of maximum likelihood estimates via penalized likelihoods with differential geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.14747v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A procedure for asymptotic bias reduction of maximum likelihood estimates of generic estimands is developed. The estimator is realized as a plug-in estimator, where the parameter maximizes the penalized likelihood with a penalty function that satisfies a quasi-linear partial differential equation of the first order. The integration of the partial differential equation with the aid of differential geometry is discussed. Applications to generalized linear models, linear mixed-effects models, and a location-scale family are presented.</description>

      <title>G-Formula for Observational Studies under Stratified Interference, with Application to Bed Net Use on Malaria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.01155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing population-level effects of vaccines and other infectious disease prevention measures is important to the field of public health. In infectious disease studies, one person's treatment may affect another individual's outcome, i.e., there may be interference between units. For example, the use of bed nets to prevent malaria by one individual may have an indirect effect on other individuals living in close proximity. In some settings, individuals may form groups or clusters where interference only occurs within groups, i.e., there is partial interference. Inverse probability weighted estimators have previously been developed for observational studies with partial interference. Unfortunately, these estimators are not well suited for studies with large clusters. Therefore, in this paper, the parametric g-formula is extended to allow for partial interference. G-formula estimators are proposed for overall effects, effects when treated, and effects when untreated. The proposed estimators can accommodate large clusters and do not suffer from the g-null paradox that may occur in the absence of interference. The large sample properties of the proposed estimators are derived assuming no unmeasured confounders and that the partial interference takes a particular form (referred to as `weak stratified interference'). Simulation studies are presented demonstrating the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. The Demographic and Health Survey from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is then analyzed using the proposed g-formula estimators to assess the effects of bed net use on malaria.</description>

      <title>On a class of Sobolev tests for symmetry of directions, their detection thresholds, and asymptotic powers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of symmetry hypothesis testing problems including testing isotropy on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and testing rotational symmetry on the hypersphere $\mathcal{S}^{d-1}$. For this class, we study the null and non-null behaviors of Sobolev tests, with emphasis on their consistency rates. Our main results show that: (i) Sobolev tests exhibit a detection threshold (see Bhattacharya, 2019, 2020) that does not only depend on the coefficients defining these tests; and (ii) tests with non-zero coefficients at odd (respectively, even) ranks only are blind to alternatives with angular functions whose $k$th-order derivatives at zero vanish for any $k$ odd (even). Our non-standard asymptotic results are illustrated with Monte Carlo exercises. A case study in astronomy applies the testing toolbox to evaluate the symmetry of orbits of long- and short-period comets.</description>

      <title>An unbiased estimator of the case fatality rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.03087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During an epidemic outbreak of a new disease, the probability of dying once infected is considered an important though difficult task to be computed. Since it is very hard to know the true number of infected people, the focus is placed on estimating the case fatality rate, which is defined as the probability of dying once tested and confirmed as infected. The estimation of this rate at the beginning of an epidemic remains challenging for several reasons, including the time gap between diagnosis and death, and the rapid growth in the number of confirmed cases. In this work, an unbiased estimator of the case fatality rate of a virus is presented. The consistency of the estimator is demonstrated, and its asymptotic distribution is derived, enabling the corresponding confidence intervals (C.I.) to be established. The proposed method is based on the distribution F of the time between confirmation and death of individuals who die because of the virus. The estimator's performance is analyzed in both simulation scenarios and the real-world context of Argentina in 2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic, consistently achieving excellent results when compared to an existing proposal as well as to the conventional \naive" estimator that was employed to report the case fatality rates during the last COVID-19 pandemic. In the simulated scenarios, the empirical coverage of our C.I. is studied, both using the F employed to generate the data and an estimated F, and it is observed that the desired level of confidence is reached quickly when using real F and in a reasonable period of time when estimating F.</description>

Abstract: This article gives a conceptual review of the e-value, ev(H|X) -- the epistemic value of hypothesis H given observations X. This statistical significance measure was developed in order to allow logically coherent and consistent tests of hypotheses, including sharp or precise hypotheses, via the Full Bayesian Significance Test (FBST). Arguments of analysis allow a full characterization of this statistical test by its logical or compositional properties, showing a mutual complementarity between results of mathematical statistics and the logical desiderata lying at the foundations of this theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07243v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of stochastic approximation algorithms where iterates, in expectation, progress towards an objective at each step. When progress is proportional to the step size of the algorithm, we prove exponential concentration bounds. These tail-bounds contrast asymptotic normality results, which are more frequently associated with stochastic approximation. The methods that we develop rely on a geometric ergodicity proof. This extends a result on Markov chains due to Hajek (1982) to the area of stochastic approximation algorithms. We apply our results to several different Stochastic Approximation algorithms, specifically Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent, Kiefer-Wolfowitz and Stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithms. When applicable, our results prove faster $O(1/t)$ and linear convergence rates for Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent with a non-vanishing gradient.</description>

      <title>Tandem clustering with invariant coordinate selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06108v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For multivariate data, tandem clustering is a well-known technique aiming to improve cluster identification through initial dimension reduction. Nevertheless, the usual approach using principal component analysis (PCA) has been criticized for focusing solely on inertia so that the first components do not necessarily retain the structure of interest for clustering. To address this limitation, a new tandem clustering approach based on invariant coordinate selection (ICS) is proposed. By jointly diagonalizing two scatter matrices, ICS is designed to find structure in the data while providing affine invariant components. Certain theoretical results have been previously derived and guarantee that under some elliptical mixture models, the group structure can be highlighted on a subset of the first and/or last components. However, ICS has garnered minimal attention within the context of clustering. Two challenges associated with ICS include choosing the pair of scatter matrices and selecting the components to retain. For effective clustering purposes, it is demonstrated that the best scatter pairs consist of one scatter matrix capturing the within-cluster structure and another capturing the global structure. For the former, local shape or pairwise scatters are of great interest, as is the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator based on a carefully chosen subset size that is smaller than usual. The performance of ICS as a dimension reduction method is evaluated in terms of preserving the cluster structure in the data. In an extensive simulation study and empirical applications with benchmark data sets, various combinations of scatter matrices as well as component selection criteria are compared in situations with and without outliers. Overall, the new approach of tandem clustering with ICS shows promising results and clearly outperforms the PCA-based approach.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of MLE for Entity Ranking with Covariates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns with statistical estimation and inference for the ranking problems based on pairwise comparisons with additional covariate information such as the attributes of the compared items. Despite extensive studies, few prior literatures investigate this problem under the more realistic setting where covariate information exists. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel model, Covariate-Assisted Ranking Estimation (CARE) model, that extends the well-known Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, by incorporating the covariate information. Specifically, instead of assuming every compared item has a fixed latent score $\{\theta_i^*\}_{i=1}^n$, we assume the underlying scores are given by $\{\alpha_i^*+{x}_i^\top\beta^*\}_{i=1}^n$, where $\alpha_i^*$ and ${x}_i^\top\beta^*$ represent latent baseline and covariate score of the $i$-th item, respectively. We impose natural identifiability conditions and derive the $\ell_{\infty}$- and $\ell_2$-optimal rates for the maximum likelihood estimator of $\{\alpha_i^*\}_{i=1}^{n}$ and $\beta^*$ under a sparse comparison graph, using a novel `leave-one-out' technique (Chen et al., 2019) . To conduct statistical inferences, we further derive asymptotic distributions for the MLE of $\{\alpha_i^*\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\beta^*$ with minimal sample complexity. This allows us to answer the question whether some covariates have any explanation power for latent scores and to threshold some sparse parameters to improve the ranking performance. We improve the approximation method used in (Gao et al., 2021) for the BLT model and generalize it to the CARE model. Moreover, we validate our theoretical results through large-scale numerical studies and an application to the mutual fund stock holding dataset.</description>

Abstract: It is often necessary to introduce the main characteristics of population mobility dynamics to model critical social phenomena such as the economy, violence, transmission of information, or infectious diseases. In this work, we focus on modeling and inferring urban population mobility using the geospatial data of its inhabitants. The objective is to estimate mobility and times inhabitants spend in the areas of interest, such as zip codes and census geographical areas. The proposed method uses the Brownian bridge model for animal movement in ecology. We illustrate its possible applications using mobile phone GPS data in 2020 from the city of Hermosillo, Sonora, in Mexico. We incorporate the estimated residence-mobility matrix into a multi-patch compartmental SEIR model to assess the effect of mobility changes due to governmental interventions</description>

      <title>Improving instrumental variable estimators with post-stratification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments studying get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts estimate the causal effect of various mobilization efforts on voter turnout. However, there is often substantial noncompliance in these studies. A usual approach is to use an instrumental variable (IV) analysis to estimate impacts for compliers, here being those actually contacted by the investigators. Unfortunately, popular IV estimators can be unstable in studies with a small fraction of compliers. We explore post-stratifying the data (e.g., taking a weighted average of IV estimates within each stratum) using variables that predict complier status (and, potentially, the outcome) to mitigate this. We present the benefits of post-stratification in terms of bias, variance, and improved standard error estimates, and provide a finite-sample asymptotic variance formula. We also compare the performance of different IV approaches and discuss the advantages of our design-based post-stratification approach over incorporating compliance-predictive covariates into the two-stage least squares estimator. In the end, we show that covariates predictive of compliance can increase precision, but only if one is willing to make a bias-variance trade-off by down-weighting or dropping strata with few compliers. By contrast, standard approaches such as two-stage least squares fail to use such information. We finally examine the benefits of our approach in two GOTV applications.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent with MCMC Estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants is essential for machine learning. However, most of the preceding analyses are conducted under amenable conditions such as unbiased gradient estimator and bounded objective functions, which does not encompass many sophisticated applications, such as variational Monte Carlo, entropy-regularized reinforcement learning and variational inference. In this paper, we consider the SGD algorithm that employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimator to compute the gradient, called MCMC-SGD. Since MCMC reduces the sampling complexity significantly, it is an asymptotically convergent biased estimator in practice. Moreover, by incorporating a general class of unbounded functions, it is much more difficult to analyze the MCMC sampling error. Therefore, we assume that the function is sub-exponential and use the Bernstein inequality for non-stationary Markov chains to derive error bounds of the MCMC estimator. Consequently, MCMC-SGD is proven to have a first order convergence rate $O(\log K/\sqrt{n K})$ with $K$ iterations and a sample size $n$. It partially explains how MCMC influences the behavior of SGD. Furthermore, we verify the correlated negative curvature condition under reasonable assumptions. It is shown that MCMC-SGD escapes from saddle points and reaches $(\epsilon,\epsilon^{1/4})$ approximate second order stationary points or $\epsilon^{1/2}$-variance points at least $O(\epsilon^{-11/2}\log^{2}(1/\epsilon) )$ steps with high probability. Our analysis unveils the convergence pattern of MCMC-SGD across a broad class of stochastic optimization problems, and interprets the convergence phenomena observed in practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Sparse joint shift (SJS) was recently proposed as a tractable model for general dataset shift which may cause changes to the marginal distributions of features and labels as well as the posterior probabilities and the class-conditional feature distributions. Fitting SJS for a target dataset without label observations may produce valid predictions of labels and estimates of class prior probabilities. We present new results on the transmission of SJS from sets of features to larger sets of features, a conditional correction formula for the class posterior probabilities under the target distribution, identifiability of SJS, and the relationship between SJS and covariate shift. In addition, we point out inconsistencies in the algorithms which were proposed for estimating the characteristics of SJS, as they could hamper the search for optimal solutions, and suggest potential improvements.</description>

      <title>Testing for linearity in scalar-on-function regression with responses missing at random</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A goodness-of-fit test for the Functional Linear Model with Scalar Response (FLMSR) with responses Missing at Random (MAR) is proposed in this paper. The test statistic relies on a marked empirical process indexed by the projected functional covariate and its distribution under the null hypothesis is calibrated using a wild bootstrap procedure. The computation and performance of the test rely on having an accurate estimator of the functional slope of the FLMSR when the sample has MAR responses. Three estimation methods based on the Functional Principal Components (FPCs) of the covariate are considered. First, the simplified method estimates the functional slope by simply discarding observations with missing responses. Second, the imputed method estimates the functional slope by imputing the missing responses using the simplified estimator. Third, the inverse probability weighted method incorporates the missing response generation mechanism when imputing. Furthermore, both cross-validation and LASSO regression are used to select the FPCs used by each estimator. Several Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to analyze the behavior of the testing procedure in combination with the functional slope estimators. Results indicate that estimators performing missing-response imputation achieve the highest power. The testing procedure is applied to check for linear dependence between the average number of sunny days per year and the mean curve of daily temperatures at weather stations in Spain.</description>

Abstract: Gaussian mixture block models are distributions over graphs that strive to model modern networks: to generate a graph from such a model, we associate each vertex $i$ with a latent feature vector $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ sampled from a mixture of Gaussians, and we add edge $(i,j)$ if and only if the feature vectors are sufficiently similar, in that $\langle u_i,u_j \rangle \ge \tau$ for a pre-specified threshold $\tau$. The different components of the Gaussian mixture represent the fact that there may be different types of nodes with different distributions over features -- for example, in a social network each component represents the different attributes of a distinct community. Natural algorithmic tasks associated with these networks are embedding (recovering the latent feature vectors) and clustering (grouping nodes by their mixture component).
  In this paper we initiate the study of clustering and embedding graphs sampled from high-dimensional Gaussian mixture block models, where the dimension of the latent feature vectors $d\to \infty$ as the size of the network $n \to \infty$. This high-dimensional setting is most appropriate in the context of modern networks, in which we think of the latent feature space as being high-dimensional. We analyze the performance of canonical spectral clustering and embedding algorithms for such graphs in the case of 2-component spherical Gaussian mixtures, and begin to sketch out the information-computation landscape for clustering and embedding in these models.</description>

Abstract: The Network Scale-up Method (NSUM) uses social networks and answers to "How many X's do you know?" questions to estimate sizes of groups excluded by standard surveys. This paper addresses the bias caused by varying average social network sizes across populations, commonly referred to as the degree ratio bias. This bias is especially important for marginalized populations like sex workers and drug users, where members tend to have smaller social networks than the average person. We show how the degree ratio affects size estimates and provide a method to estimate degree ratios without collecting additional data. We demonstrate that our adjustment procedure improves the accuracy of NSUM size estimates using simulations and data from two data sources.</description>

Abstract: Conditional independence (CI) tests are widely used in statistical data analysis, e.g., they are the building block of many algorithms for causal graph discovery. The goal of a CI test is to accept or reject the null hypothesis that $X \perp \!\!\! \perp Y \mid Z$, where $X \in \mathbb{R}, Y \in \mathbb{R}, Z \in \mathbb{R}^d$. In this work, we investigate conditional independence testing under the constraint of differential privacy. We design two private CI testing procedures: one based on the generalized covariance measure of Shah and Peters (2020) and another based on the conditional randomization test of Cand\`es et al. (2016) (under the model-X assumption). We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of our tests and validate them empirically. These are the first private CI tests with rigorous theoretical guarantees that work for the general case when $Z$ is continuous.</description>

      <title>Samplet basis pursuit: Multiresolution scattered data approximation with sparsity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider scattered data approximation in samplet coordinates with $\ell_1$-regularization. The application of an $\ell_1$-regularization term enforces sparsity of the coefficients with respect to the samplet basis. Samplets are wavelet-type signed measures, which are tailored to scattered data. They provide similar properties as wavelets in terms of localization, multiresolution analysis, and data compression. By using the Riesz isometry, we embed samplets into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and discuss the properties of the resulting functions. We argue that the class of signals that are sparse with respect to the embedded samplet basis is considerably larger than the class of signals that are sparse with respect to the basis of kernel translates. Vice versa, every signal that is a linear combination of only a few kernel translates is sparse in samplet coordinates. Therefore, samplets enable the use of well-established multiresolution techniques on general scattered data sets.
  We propose the rapid solution of the problem under consideration by combining soft-shrinkage with the semi-smooth Newton method. Leveraging on the sparse representation of kernel matrices in samplet coordinates, this approach converges faster than the fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm and is feasible for large-scale data. Numerical benchmarks are presented and demonstrate the superiority of the multiresolution approach over the single-scale approach. As large-scale applications, the surface reconstruction from scattered data and the reconstruction of scattered temperature data using a dictionary of multiple kernels are considered.</description>

      <title>Automated Reminders Reduce Incarceration for Missed Court Dates: Evidence from a Text Message Experiment</title>

Abstract: Millions of Americans must attend mandatory court dates every year. To boost appearance rates, jurisdictions nationwide are increasingly turning to automated reminders, but previous research offers mixed evidence on their effectiveness. In partnership with the Santa Clara County Public Defender Office, we randomly assigned 5,709 public defender clients to either receive automated text message reminders (treatment) or not receive reminders (control). We found that reminders reduced warrants issued for missed court dates by approximately 20%, with 12.1% of clients in the control condition issued a warrant compared to 9.7% of clients in the treatment condition. We further found that incarceration from missed court dates dropped by a similar amount, from 6.2% in the control condition to 4.8% in the treatment condition. Our results provide evidence that automated reminders can help people avoid the negative consequences of missing court.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most link prediction methods return estimates of the connection probability of missing edges in a graph. Such output can be used to rank the missing edges from most to least likely to be a true edge, but does not directly provide a classification into true and non-existent. In this work, we consider the problem of identifying a set of true edges with a control of the false discovery rate (FDR). We propose a novel method based on high-level ideas from the literature on conformal inference. The graph structure induces intricate dependence in the data, which we carefully take into account, as this makes the setup different from the usual setup in conformal inference, where data exchangeability is assumed. The FDR control is empirically demonstrated for both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Causal Meta-Analysis by Integrating Multiple Observational Studies with Multivariate Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating multiple observational studies to make unconfounded causal or descriptive comparisons of group potential outcomes in a large natural population is challenging. Moreover, retrospective cohorts, being convenience samples, are usually unrepresentative of the natural population of interest and have groups with unbalanced covariates. We propose a general covariate-balancing framework based on pseudo-populations that extends established weighting methods to the meta-analysis of multiple retrospective cohorts with multiple groups. Additionally, by maximizing the effective sample sizes of the cohorts, we propose a FLEXible, Optimized, and Realistic (FLEXOR) weighting method appropriate for integrative analyses. We develop new weighted estimators for unconfounded inferences on wide-ranging population-level features and estimands relevant to group comparisons of quantitative, categorical, or multivariate outcomes. The asymptotic properties of these estimators are examined. Through simulation studies and meta-analyses of TCGA datasets, we demonstrate the versatility and reliability of the proposed weighting strategy, especially for the FLEXOR pseudo-population.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Structure Learning in Undirected Gaussian Graphical Models: Literature Review with Empirical Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian graphical models provide a powerful framework to reveal the conditional dependency structure between multivariate variables. The process of uncovering the conditional dependency network is known as structure learning. Bayesian methods can measure the uncertainty of conditional relationships and include prior information. However, frequentist methods are often preferred due to the computational burden of the Bayesian approach. Over the last decade, Bayesian methods have seen substantial improvements, with some now capable of generating accurate estimates of graphs up to a thousand variables in mere minutes. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive review or empirical comparison of all recent methods has not been conducted. This paper delves into a wide spectrum of Bayesian approaches used for structure learning and evaluates their efficacy through a simulation study. We also demonstrate how to apply Bayesian structure learning to a real-world data set and provide directions for future research. This study gives an exhaustive overview of this dynamic field for newcomers, practitioners, and experts.</description>

      <title>A Plot is Worth a Thousand Tests: Assessing Residual Diagnostics with the Lineup Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression experts consistently recommend plotting residuals for model diagnosis, despite the availability of many numerical hypothesis test procedures designed to use residuals to assess problems with a model fit. Here we provide evidence for why this is good advice using data from a visual inference experiment. We show how conventional tests are too sensitive, which means that too often the conclusion would be that the model fit is inadequate. The experiment uses the lineup protocol which puts a residual plot in the context of null plots. This helps generate reliable and consistent reading of residual plots for better model diagnosis. It can also help in an obverse situation where a conventional test would fail to detect a problem with a model due to contaminated data. The lineup protocol also detects a range of departures from good residuals simultaneously. Supplemental materials for the article are available online.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Point Algorithms for Solving the Critical Value and Upper Tail Quantile of Kuiper's Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09463v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kuiper's statistic is a good measure for the difference of ideal distribution and empirical distribution in the goodness-of-fit test. However, it is a challenging problem to solve the critical value and upper tail quantile, or simply Kuiper pair, of Kuiper's statistics due to the difficulties of solving the nonlinear equation and reasonable approximation of infinite series. In this work, the contributions lie in three perspectives: firstly, the second order approximation for the infinite series of the cumulative distribution of the critical value is used to achieve higher precision; secondly, the principles and fixed-point algorithms for solving the Kuiper pair are presented with details; finally, finally, a mistake about the critical value $c^\alpha_n$ for $(\alpha, n)=(0.01,30)$ in Kuiper's distribution table has been labeled and corrected where $n$ is the sample capacity and $\alpha$ is the upper tail quantile. The algorithms are verified and validated by comparing with the table provided by Kuiper. The methods and algorithms proposed are enlightening and worth of introducing to the college students, computer programmers, engineers, experimental psychologists and so on.</description>

      <title>Learning Energy-Based Models by Cooperative Diffusion Recovery Likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training energy-based models (EBMs) on high-dimensional data can be both challenging and time-consuming, and there exists a noticeable gap in sample quality between EBMs and other generative frameworks like GANs and diffusion models. To close this gap, inspired by the recent efforts of learning EBMs by maximizing diffusion recovery likelihood (DRL), we propose cooperative diffusion recovery likelihood (CDRL), an effective approach to tractably learn and sample from a series of EBMs defined on increasingly noisy versions of a dataset, paired with an initializer model for each EBM. At each noise level, the two models are jointly estimated within a cooperative training framework: samples from the initializer serve as starting points that are refined by a few MCMC sampling steps from the EBM. The EBM is then optimized by maximizing recovery likelihood, while the initializer model is optimized by learning from the difference between the refined samples and the initial samples. In addition, we made several practical designs for EBM training to further improve the sample quality. Combining these advances, our approach significantly boost the generation performance compared to existing EBM methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our models for several downstream tasks, including classifier-free guided generation, compositional generation, image inpainting and out-of-distribution detection.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates covariance operator estimation via thresholding. For Gaussian random fields with approximately sparse covariance operators, we establish non-asymptotic bounds on the estimation error in terms of the sparsity level of the covariance and the expected supremum of the field. We prove that thresholded estimators enjoy an exponential improvement in sample complexity compared with the standard sample covariance estimator if the field has a small correlation lengthscale. As an application of the theory, we study thresholded estimation of covariance operators within ensemble Kalman filters.</description>

      <title>Identifying Linearly-Mixed Causal Representations from Multi-Node Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of inferring high-level causal variables from low-level observations, commonly referred to as causal representation learning, is fundamentally underconstrained. As such, recent works to address this problem focus on various assumptions that lead to identifiability of the underlying latent causal variables. A large corpus of these preceding approaches consider multi-environment data collected under different interventions on the causal model. What is common to virtually all of these works is the restrictive assumption that in each environment, only a single variable is intervened on. In this work, we relax this assumption and provide the first identifiability result for causal representation learning that allows for multiple variables to be targeted by an intervention within one environment. Our approach hinges on a general assumption on the coverage and diversity of interventions across environments, which also includes the shared assumption of single-node interventions of previous works. The main idea behind our approach is to exploit the trace that interventions leave on the variance of the ground truth causal variables and regularizing for a specific notion of sparsity with respect to this trace. In addition to and inspired by our theoretical contributions, we present a practical algorithm to learn causal representations from multi-node interventional data and provide empirical evidence that validates our identifiability results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an individual claims reserving model based on the conditional Aalen-Johansen estimator, as developed in Bladt and Furrer (2023b). In our approach, we formulate a multi-state problem, where the underlying variable is the individual claim size, rather than time. The states in this model represent development periods, and we estimate the cumulative density function of individual claim sizes using the conditional Aalen-Johansen method as transition probabilities to an absorbing state. Our methodology reinterprets the concept of multi-state models and offers a strategy for modeling the complete curve of individual claim sizes. To illustrate our approach, we apply our model to both simulated and real datasets. Having access to the entire dataset enables us to support the use of our approach by comparing the predicted total final cost with the actual amount, as well as evaluating it in terms of the continuously ranked probability score.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Functional Analysis for Untargeted Metabolomics Data with Matching Uncertainty and Small Sample Sizes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Untargeted metabolomics based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technology is quickly gaining widespread application given its ability to depict the global metabolic pattern in biological samples. However, the data is noisy and plagued by the lack of clear identity of data features measured from samples. Multiple potential matchings exist between data features and known metabolites, while the truth can only be one-to-one matches. Some existing methods attempt to reduce the matching uncertainty, but are far from being able to remove the uncertainty for most features. The existence of the uncertainty causes major difficulty in downstream functional analysis. To address these issues, we develop a novel approach for Bayesian Analysis of Untargeted Metabolomics data (BAUM) to integrate previously separate tasks into a single framework, including matching uncertainty inference, metabolite selection, and functional analysis. By incorporating the knowledge graph between variables and using relatively simple assumptions, BAUM can analyze datasets with small sample sizes. By allowing different confidence levels of feature-metabolite matching, the method is applicable to datasets in which feature identities are partially known. Simulation studies demonstrate that, compared with other existing methods, BAUM achieves better accuracy in selecting important metabolites that tend to be functionally consistent and assigning confidence scores to feature-metabolite matches. We analyze a COVID-19 metabolomics dataset and a mouse brain metabolomics dataset using BAUM. Even with a very small sample size of 16 mice per group, BAUM is robust and stable. It finds pathways that conform to existing knowledge, as well as novel pathways that are biologically plausible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fully Bayesian analyses, prior distributions are specified before observing data. Prior elicitation methods transfigure prior information into quantifiable prior distributions. Recently, methods that leverage copulas have been proposed to accommodate more flexible dependence structures when eliciting multivariate priors. We prove that under broad conditions, the posterior cannot retain many of these flexible prior dependence structures in large-sample settings. We emphasize the impact of this result by overviewing several objectives for prior specification to help practitioners select prior dependence structures that align with their objectives for posterior analysis. Because correctly specifying the dependence structure a priori can be difficult, we consider how the choice of prior copula impacts the posterior distribution in terms of asymptotic convergence of the posterior mode. Our resulting recommendations streamline the prior elicitation process.</description>

Abstract: Two natural ways of modelling Formula 1 race outcomes are a probabilistic approach, based on the exponential distribution, and econometric modelling of the ranks. Both approaches lead to exactly soluble race-winning probabilities. Equating race-winning probabilities leads to a set of equivalent parametrisations. This time-rank duality is attractive theoretically and leads to quicker ways of dis-entangling driver and car level effects.</description>

      <title>Handling incomplete outcomes and covariates in cluster-randomized trials: doubly-robust estimation, efficiency considerations, and sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cluster-randomized trials (CRTs), missing data can occur in various ways, including missing values in outcomes and baseline covariates at the individual or cluster level, or completely missing information for non-participants. Among the various types of missing data in CRTs, missing outcomes have attracted the most attention. However, no existing methods can simultaneously address all aforementioned types of missing data in CRTs. To fill in this gap, we propose a new doubly-robust estimator for the average treatment effect on a variety of scales. The proposed estimator simultaneously handles missing outcomes under missingness at random, missing covariates without constraining the missingness mechanism, and missing cluster-population sizes via a uniform sampling mechanism. Furthermore, we detail key considerations to improve precision by specifying the optimal weights, leveraging machine learning, and modeling the treatment assignment mechanism. Finally, to evaluate the impact of violating missing data assumptions, we contribute a new sensitivity analysis framework tailored to CRTs. Simulation studies and a real data application both demonstrate that our proposed methods are effective in handling missing data in CRTs and superior to the existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer the direct effect of multiple exposures on an outcome. Compared to univariable Mendelian randomization, MVMR is less prone to horizontal pleiotropy and enables estimation of the direct effect of each exposure on the outcome. However, MVMR faces greater challenges with weak instruments -- genetic variants that are weakly associated with some exposures conditional on the other exposures. This article focuses on MVMR using summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We provide a new asymptotic regime to analyze MVMR estimators with many weak instruments, allowing for linear combinations of exposures to have different degrees of instrument strength, and formally show that the popular multivariable inverse-variance weighted (MV-IVW) estimator's asymptotic behavior is highly sensitive to instruments' strength. We then propose a multivariable debiased IVW (MV-dIVW) estimator, which effectively reduces the asymptotic bias from weak instruments in MV-IVW, and introduce an adjusted version, MV-adIVW, for improved finite-sample robustness. We establish the theoretical properties of our proposed estimators and extend them to handle balanced horizontal pleiotropy. We conclude by demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in simulated and real datasets. We implement this method in the R package mr.divw.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Hessian Fittings on Lie Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the fitting of Hessian or its inverse for stochastic optimizations using a Hessian fitting criterion from the preconditioned stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) method, which is intimately related to many commonly used second order and adaptive gradient optimizers, e.g., BFGS, Gaussian-Newton and natural gradient descent, AdaGrad, etc. Our analyses reveal the efficiency and reliability differences among a wide range of preconditioner fitting methods, from closed-form to iterative solutions, using Hessian-vector products or stochastic gradients only, with Hessian fittings in the Euclidean space, the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPL) matrices, or a variety of Lie groups. The most intriguing discovery is that the Hessian fitting itself as an optimization problem is strongly convex under mild conditions on a specific yet general enough Lie group. This discovery turns Hessian fitting into a well behaved optimization problem, and facilitates the designs of highly efficient and elegant Lie group sparse preconditioner fitting methods for large scale stochastic optimizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vector autoregression (VAR) has been widely used in system identification, econometrics, natural science, and many other areas. However, when the state dimension becomes large the parameter dimension explodes. So rank reduced modelling is attractive and is well developed. But a fundamental requirement in almost all applications is stability of the fitted model. And this has not been addressed in the rank reduced case. Here, we develop, for the first time, a closed-form formula for an estimator of a rank reduced transition matrix which is guaranteed to be stable. We show that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically statistically efficient and illustrate it in comparative simulations.</description>

      <title>Confidence on the Focal: Conformal Prediction with Selection-Conditional Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction builds marginally valid prediction intervals that cover the unknown outcome of a randomly drawn new test point with a prescribed probability. However, a common scenario in practice is that, after seeing the data, practitioners decide which test unit(s) to focus on in a data-driven manner and seek for uncertainty quantification of the focal unit(s). In such cases, marginally valid conformal prediction intervals may not provide valid coverage for the focal unit(s) due to selection bias. This paper presents a general framework for constructing a prediction set with finite-sample exact coverage conditional on the unit being selected by a given procedure. The general form of our method works for arbitrary selection rules that are invariant to the permutation of the calibration units, and generalizes Mondrian Conformal Prediction to multiple test units and non-equivariant classifiers. We then work out the computationally efficient implementation of our framework for a number of realistic selection rules, including top-K selection, optimization-based selection, selection based on conformal p-values, and selection based on properties of preliminary conformal prediction sets. The performance of our methods is demonstrated via applications in drug discovery and health risk prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Gaussian approximation bounds for random forest predictions based on a set of training points given by a Poisson process, under fairly mild regularity assumptions on the data generating process. Our approach is based on the key observation that the random forest predictions satisfy a certain geometric property called region-based stabilization. In the process of developing our results for the random forest, we also establish a probabilistic result, which might be of independent interest, on multivariate Gaussian approximation bounds for general functionals of Poisson process that are region-based stabilizing. This general result makes use of the Malliavin-Stein method, and is potentially applicable to various related statistical problems.</description>

Abstract: Point processes are finding growing applications in numerous fields, such as neuroscience, high frequency finance and social media. So classic problems of classification and clustering are of increasing interest. However, analytic study of misclassification error probability in multi-class classification has barely begun. In this paper, we tackle the multi-class likelihood classification problem for point processes and develop, for the first time, both asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the error rate in terms of computable pair-wise affinities. We apply these general results to classifying renewal processes. Under some technical conditions, we show that the bounds have exponential decay and give explicit associated constants. The results are illustrated with a non-trivial simulation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Rosenbaum Bounds Sensitivity Analysis for Matched Observational Studies with Treatment Doses: Sufficiency, Consistency, and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In matched observational studies with binary treatments, the Rosenbaum bounds framework is arguably the most widely used sensitivity analysis framework for assessing sensitivity to unobserved covariates. Unlike the binary treatment case, although widely needed in practice, sensitivity analysis for matched observational studies with treatment doses (i.e., non-binary treatments such as ordinal treatments or continuous treatments) still lacks solid foundations and valid methodologies. We fill in this blank by establishing theoretical foundations and novel methodologies under a generalized Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis framework. First, we present a criterion for assessing the validity of sensitivity analysis in matched observational studies with treatment doses and use that criterion to justify the necessity of incorporating the treatment dose information into sensitivity analysis through generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds. We also generalize Rosenbaum's classic sensitivity parameter $\Gamma$ to the non-binary treatment case and prove its sufficiency. Second, we study the asymptotic properties of sensitivity analysis by generalizing Rosenbaum's classic design sensitivity and Bahadur efficiency for testing Fisher's sharp null to the non-binary treatment case and deriving novel formulas for them. Our theoretical results showed the importance of appropriately incorporating the treatment dose into a test, which is an intrinsic distinction with the binary treatment case. Third, for testing Neyman's weak null (i.e., null sample average treatment effect), we propose the first valid sensitivity analysis procedure for matching with treatment dose through generalizing an existing optimization-based sensitivity analysis for the binary treatment case, built on the generalized Rosenbaum sensitivity bounds and large-scale mixed integer programming.</description>

      <title>CrossQ: Batch Normalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Greater Sample Efficiency and Simplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.05605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sample efficiency is a crucial problem in deep reinforcement learning. Recent algorithms, such as REDQ and DroQ, found a way to improve the sample efficiency by increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ratio to 20 gradient update steps on the critic per environment sample. However, this comes at the expense of a greatly increased computational cost. To reduce this computational burden, we introduce CrossQ: A lightweight algorithm for continuous control tasks that makes careful use of Batch Normalization and removes target networks to surpass the current state-of-the-art in sample efficiency while maintaining a low UTD ratio of 1. Notably, CrossQ does not rely on advanced bias-reduction schemes used in current methods. CrossQ's contributions are threefold: (1) it matches or surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample efficiency, (2) it substantially reduces the computational cost compared to REDQ and DroQ, (3) it is easy to implement, requiring just a few lines of code on top of SAC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy is a mathematical concept that provides an information-theoretic security guarantee. While differential privacy has emerged as a de facto standard for guaranteeing privacy in data sharing, the known mechanisms to achieve it come with some serious limitations. Utility guarantees are usually provided only for a fixed, a priori specified set of queries. Moreover, there are no utility guarantees for more complex - but very common - machine learning tasks such as clustering or classification. In this paper we overcome some of these limitations. Working with metric privacy, a powerful generalization of differential privacy, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that creates a private measure from a data set. This private measure allows us to efficiently construct private synthetic data that are accurate for a wide range of statistical analysis tools. Moreover, we prove an asymptotically sharp min-max result for private measures and synthetic data for general compact metric spaces. A key ingredient in our construction is a new superregular random walk, whose joint distribution of steps is as regular as that of independent random variables, yet which deviates from the origin logarithmicaly slowly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a family of iterative algorithms that involve the repeated execution of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms. One interesting member of this family is motivated by the discrete Fourier transform uncertainty principle and involves the application of a sparsification operation to both the real domain and frequency domain data with convergence obtained when real domain sparsity hits a stable pattern. This sparsification variant has practical utility for signal denoising, in particular the recovery of a periodic spike signal in the presence of Gaussian noise. General convergence properties and denoising performance relative to existing methods are demonstrated using simulation studies. An R package implementing this technique and related resources can be found at https://hrfrost.host.dartmouth.edu/IterativeFT.</description>

      <title>Dual Accuracy-Quality-Driven Neural Network for Prediction Interval Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is necessary to enhance the reliability of deep learning models in real-world applications. In the case of regression tasks, prediction intervals (PIs) should be provided along with the deterministic predictions of deep learning models. Such PIs are useful or "high-quality" as long as they are sufficiently narrow and capture most of the probability density. In this paper, we present a method to learn prediction intervals for regression-based neural networks automatically in addition to the conventional target predictions. In particular, we train two companion neural networks: one that uses one output, the target estimate, and another that uses two outputs, the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding PI. Our main contribution is the design of a novel loss function for the PI-generation network that takes into account the output of the target-estimation network and has two optimization objectives: minimizing the mean prediction interval width and ensuring the PI integrity using constraints that maximize the prediction interval probability coverage implicitly. Furthermore, we introduce a self-adaptive coefficient that balances both objectives within the loss function, which alleviates the task of fine-tuning. Experiments using a synthetic dataset, eight benchmark datasets, and a real-world crop yield prediction dataset showed that our method was able to maintain a nominal probability coverage and produce significantly narrower PIs without detriment to its target estimation accuracy when compared to those PIs generated by three state-of-the-art neural-network-based methods. In other words, our method was shown to produce higher-quality PIs.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian methods, distributionally robust optimization methods, and regularization methods are three pillars of trustworthy machine learning combating distributional uncertainty, e.g., the uncertainty of an empirical distribution compared to the true underlying distribution. This paper investigates the connections among the three frameworks and, in particular, explores why these frameworks tend to have smaller generalization errors. Specifically, first, we suggest a quantitative definition for "distributional robustness", propose the concept of "robustness measure", and formalize several philosophical concepts in distributionally robust optimization. Second, we show that Bayesian methods are distributionally robust in the probably approximately correct (PAC) sense; in addition, by constructing a Dirichlet-process-like prior in Bayesian nonparametrics, it can be proven that any regularized empirical risk minimization method is equivalent to a Bayesian method. Third, we show that generalization errors of machine learning models can be characterized using the distributional uncertainty of the nominal distribution and the robustness measures of these machine learning models, which is a new perspective to bound generalization errors, and therefore, explain the reason why distributionally robust machine learning models, Bayesian models, and regularization models tend to have smaller generalization errors in a unified manner.</description>

      <title>The autoregressive neural network architecture of the Boltzmann distribution of pairwise interacting spins systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Autoregressive Neural Networks (ARNNs) have recently demonstrated exceptional results in image and language generation tasks, contributing to the growing popularity of generative models in both scientific and commercial applications. This work presents an exact mapping of the Boltzmann distribution of binary pairwise interacting systems into autoregressive form. The resulting ARNN architecture has weights and biases of its first layer corresponding to the Hamiltonian's couplings and external fields, featuring widely used structures such as the residual connections and a recurrent architecture with clear physical meanings. Moreover, its architecture's explicit formulation enables the use of statistical physics techniques to derive new ARNNs for specific systems. As examples, new effective ARNN architectures are derived from two well-known mean-field systems, the Curie-Weiss and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick models, showing superior performance in approximating the Boltzmann distributions of the corresponding physics model compared to other commonly used architectures. The connection established between the physics of the system and the neural network architecture provides a means to derive new architectures for different interacting systems and interpret existing ones from a physical perspective.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapped Training of Score-Conditioned Generator for Offline Design of Biological Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing biological sequences, e.g., proteins, DNA, and RNA, to maximize a black-box score function that is only evaluated in an offline dataset. We propose a novel solution, bootstrapped training of score-conditioned generator (BootGen) algorithm. Our algorithm repeats a two-stage process. In the first stage, our algorithm trains the biological sequence generator with rank-based weights to enhance the accuracy of sequence generation based on high scores. The subsequent stage involves bootstrapping, which augments the training dataset with self-generated data labeled by a proxy score function. Our key idea is to align the score-based generation with a proxy score function, which distills the knowledge of the proxy score function to the generator. After training, we aggregate samples from multiple bootstrapped generators and proxies to produce a diverse design. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms competitive baselines on biological sequential design tasks.

Our approach is based on a minimal set of conditions for observation and background estimators, which are typically satisfied in practical scenarios.

      <description>arXiv:2310.01327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new model for multivariate probabilistic time series prediction, designed to flexibly address a range of tasks including forecasting, interpolation, and their combinations. Building on copula theory, we propose a simplified objective for the recently-introduced transformer-based attentional copulas (TACTiS), wherein the number of distributional parameters now scales linearly with the number of variables instead of factorially. The new objective requires the introduction of a training curriculum, which goes hand-in-hand with necessary changes to the original architecture. We show that the resulting model has significantly better training dynamics and achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse real-world forecasting tasks, while maintaining the flexibility of prior work, such as seamless handling of unaligned and unevenly-sampled time series. Code is made available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/TACTiS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized sampling methods that learn a distribution over discrete objects proportional to their rewards. GFlowNets exhibit a remarkable ability to generate diverse samples, yet occasionally struggle to consistently produce samples with high rewards due to over-exploration on wide sample space. This paper proposes to train GFlowNets with local search, which focuses on exploiting high-rewarded sample space to resolve this issue. Our main idea is to explore the local neighborhood via backtracking and reconstruction guided by backward and forward policies, respectively. This allows biasing the samples toward high-reward solutions, which is not possible for a typical GFlowNet solution generation scheme, which uses the forward policy to generate the solution from scratch. Extensive experiments demonstrate a remarkable performance improvement in several biochemical tasks. Source code is available: \url{https://github.com/dbsxodud-11/ls_gfn}.</description>

      <title>PhyloGFN: Phylogenetic inference with generative flow networks</title>

Abstract: Phylogenetics is a branch of computational biology that studies the evolutionary relationships among biological entities. Its long history and numerous applications notwithstanding, inference of phylogenetic trees from sequence data remains challenging: the high complexity of tree space poses a significant obstacle for the current combinatorial and probabilistic techniques. In this paper, we adopt the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to tackle two core problems in phylogenetics: parsimony-based and Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Because GFlowNets are well-suited for sampling complex combinatorial structures, they are a natural choice for exploring and sampling from the multimodal posterior distribution over tree topologies and evolutionary distances. We demonstrate that our amortized posterior sampler, PhyloGFN, produces diverse and high-quality evolutionary hypotheses on real benchmark datasets. PhyloGFN is competitive with prior works in marginal likelihood estimation and achieves a closer fit to the target distribution than state-of-the-art variational inference methods.

      <title>A Poincar\'e Inequality and Consistency Results for Signal Sampling on Large Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale graph machine learning is challenging as the complexity of learning models scales with the graph size. Subsampling the graph is a viable alternative, but sampling on graphs is nontrivial as graphs are non-Euclidean. Existing graph sampling techniques require not only computing the spectra of large matrices but also repeating these computations when the graph changes, e.g., grows. In this paper, we introduce a signal sampling theory for a type of graph limit -- the graphon. We prove a Poincar\'e inequality for graphon signals and show that complements of node subsets satisfying this inequality are unique sampling sets for Paley-Wiener spaces of graphon signals. Exploiting connections with spectral clustering and Gaussian elimination, we prove that such sampling sets are consistent in the sense that unique sampling sets on a convergent graph sequence converge to unique sampling sets on the graphon. We then propose a related graphon signal sampling algorithm for large graphs, and demonstrate its good empirical performance on graph machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayes image restoration with compressive autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.</description>

      <title>Featurizing Koopman Mode Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces an advanced Koopman mode decomposition (KMD) technique -- coined Featurized Koopman Mode Decomposition (FKMD) -- that uses time embedding and Mahalanobis scaling to enhance analysis and prediction of high dimensional dynamical systems. The time embedding expands the observation space to better capture underlying manifold structure, while the Mahalanobis scaling, applied to kernel or random Fourier features, adjusts observations based on the system's dynamics. This aids in featurizing KMD in cases where good features are not a priori known. We find that the Mahalanobis scaling from FKMD can be used for effective dimensionality reduction of alanine dipeptide data. We also show that FKMD improves predictions for a high-dimensional Lorenz attractor and a cell signaling problem from cancer research.</description>

      <title>Thompson Sampling for Stochastic Bandits with Noisy Contexts: An Information-Theoretic Regret Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a stochastic contextual linear bandit problem where the agent observes a noisy, corrupted version of the true context through a noise channel with an unknown noise parameter. Our objective is to design an action policy that can approximate" that of an oracle, which has access to the reward model, the channel parameter, and the predictive distribution of the true context from the observed noisy context. In a Bayesian framework, we introduce a Thompson sampling algorithm for Gaussian bandits with Gaussian context noise. Adopting an information-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate the Bayesian regret of our algorithm concerning the oracle's action policy. We also extend this problem to a scenario where the agent observes the true context with some delay after receiving the reward and show that delayed true contexts lead to lower Bayesian regret. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms against baselines.</description>

      <title>Distribution-consistency Structural Causal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of causal modeling, potential outcomes (PO) and structural causal models (SCMs) stand as the predominant frameworks. However, these frameworks face notable challenges in practically modeling counterfactuals, formalized as parameters of the joint distribution of potential outcomes. Counterfactual reasoning holds paramount importance in contemporary decision-making processes, especially in scenarios that demand personalized incentives based on the joint values of $(Y(0), Y(1))$. This paper begins with an investigation of the PO and SCM frameworks for modeling counterfactuals. Through the analysis, we identify an inherent model capacity limitation, termed as the ``degenerative counterfactual problem'', emerging from the consistency rule that is the cornerstone of both frameworks. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel \textit{distribution-consistency} assumption, and in alignment with it, we propose the Distribution-consistency Structural Causal Models (DiscoSCMs) offering enhanced capabilities to model counterfactuals. To concretely reveal the enhanced model capacity, we introduce a new identifiable causal parameter, \textit{the probability of consistency}, which holds practical significance within DiscoSCM alone, showcased with a personalized incentive example. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive set of theoretical results about the ``Ladder of Causation'' within the DiscoSCM framework. We hope it opens new avenues for future research of counterfactual modeling, ultimately enhancing our understanding of causality and its real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Inference for Regression with Variables Generated from Unstructured Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leading strategy for analyzing unstructured data uses two steps. First, latent variables of economic interest are estimated with an upstream information retrieval model. Second, the estimates are treated as "data" in a downstream econometric model. We establish theoretical arguments for why this two-step strategy leads to biased inference in empirically plausible settings. More constructively, we propose a one-step strategy for valid inference that uses the upstream and downstream models jointly. The one-step strategy (i) substantially reduces bias in simulations; (ii) has quantitatively important effects in a leading application using CEO time-use data; and (iii) can be readily adapted by applied researchers.</description>

      <title>Effect of Ambient-Intrinsic Dimension Gap on Adversarial Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of adversarial attacks on machine learning models imperceptible to a human is still quite a mystery from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we introduce two notions of adversarial attacks: natural or on-manifold attacks, which are perceptible by a human/oracle, and unnatural or off-manifold attacks, which are not. We argue that the existence of the off-manifold attacks is a natural consequence of the dimension gap between the intrinsic and ambient dimensions of the data. For 2-layer ReLU networks, we prove that even though the dimension gap does not affect generalization performance on samples drawn from the observed data space, it makes the clean-trained model more vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in the off-manifold direction of the data space. Our main results provide an explicit relationship between the $\ell_2,\ell_{\infty}$ attack strength of the on/off-manifold attack and the dimension gap.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on learning from preferences and choices with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference modelling lies at the intersection of economics, decision theory, machine learning and statistics. By understanding individuals' preferences and how they make choices, we can build products that closely match their expectations, paving the way for more efficient and personalised applications across a wide range of domains. The objective of this tutorial is to present a cohesive and comprehensive framework for preference learning with Gaussian Processes (GPs), demonstrating how to seamlessly incorporate rationality principles (from economics and decision theory) into the learning process. By suitably tailoring the likelihood function, this framework enables the construction of preference learning models that encompass random utility models, limits of discernment, and scenarios with multiple conflicting utilities for both object- and label-preference. This tutorial builds upon established research while simultaneously introducing some novel GP-based models to address specific gaps in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Extracting Emotion Phrases from Tweets using BART</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that aims to identify and extract the emotional aspects of a text. However, many existing sentiment analysis methods primarily classify the overall polarity of a text, overlooking the specific phrases that convey sentiment. In this paper, we applied an approach to sentiment analysis based on a question-answering framework. Our approach leverages the power of Bidirectional Autoregressive Transformer (BART), a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model, to extract a phrase from a given text that amplifies a given sentiment polarity. We create a natural language question that identifies the specific emotion to extract and then guide BART to pay attention to the relevant emotional cues in the text. We use a classifier within BART to predict the start and end positions of the answer span within the text, which helps to identify the precise boundaries of the extracted emotion phrase. Our approach offers several advantages over most sentiment analysis studies, including capturing the complete context and meaning of the text and extracting precise token spans that highlight the intended sentiment. We achieved an end loss of 87% and Jaccard score of 0.61.</description>
