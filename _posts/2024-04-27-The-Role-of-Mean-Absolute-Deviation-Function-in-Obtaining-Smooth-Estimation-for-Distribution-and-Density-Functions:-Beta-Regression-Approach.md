Smooth Estimation of probability density and distribution functions from its sample is an attractive and an important problem that has applications in several fields such as, business, medicine, and environment. This article introduces a simple approach but novel for estimating both functions in one process to have smooth curves for both via left mean absolute deviation (MAD) function and beta regression approach. Our approach explores estimation of both functions by smoothing the first derivative of left MAD function to obtain the final optimal smooth estimates. The derivation for these final smooth estimates under conditions of nondecreasing distribution function and nonnegative density function are performed by applying beta regression of a polynomial degree on the first derivative of left MAD function where the degree of polynomial is chosen among the models that have less mean absolute residuals under the constraint of nonnegativity for the first derivative of regression vector of expected values. A general class of normal, logistic and Gumbel distributions is derived as proposed smooth estimators for the distribution and density functions using logit, probit and cloglog links, respectively. This approach is applied to simulated data from unimodal, bimodal, tri-modal and skew distributions and an application to real data set is given.
